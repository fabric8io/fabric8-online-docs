= {rhosio} Overview

{rhosio} is a highly collaborative open-source, web-based _application lifecycle management_ (ALM) solution. It is a next-generation product for developers to manage the development lifecycle with one efficient tool.

== Features

{osio} offers features to seamlessly manage end-to-end application development. Members of distributed teams can use it to perform the following tasks without leaving the browser window:

*Project Management:*

* Project planning and issue tracking using your choice of Agile methodology.
* Automating project releases.

*Project Development:*

* Creating development environments and testing based on requirements.
* Coding using an integrated development environment based on Eclipse Che, which provides a workspace for developing your application.
* Development in this context-aware environment provides the appropriate context for the developer and project, such as which branch, repository, language, and files are referenced.
* Interacting with integrated GitHub repositories.
* Compiling and reviewing code in Pull Requests as required.
* Use the QuickStart wizards to create basic applications with their own new repo on GitHub, a build pipeline integrated with Jenkins, and a related new OpenShift project.
* Using migration wizards to migrate legacy J2EE applications to the cloud.

*Deployment and Testing:*

* Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring codebases using Continuous Integration pipelines that can be tailored to the requirements of a team or an individual.
* Deploying applications packaged as a set of containers to OpenShift, which powers the underlying services such as the Eclipse Che workspaces and Pipelines.
* Using integrated but customizable Jenkins build pipelines to facilitate rapid testing and environment promotion.

*Analysis and Recommendations:*

* Use the full-stack analysis feature on your project's open source components to identify potential security issues and recommend safer alternative components or component versions to use instead.
* Use the self-learning analytics engine to improve the code quality and make data-based choices. The engine scans community libraries, security vulnerabilities, and other GitHub metrics to provide useful real-time assistance for developers that learns and improves over time.
