[#working_with_an_existing_work_item]
= Working with an Existing Work Item

Click btn:[Plan] at the top of the page to view the Planner.

The *Backlog* view is the default view in the Planner and it displays all the Iterations included in the space. Iterations are sorted into one of the following categories:

* *Current Iteration* lists the currently started Iteration. Note that setting a new Iteration's start date to the current date does not start the Iteration. Instead, users must click the options (image:kabob.png[title="More"]) icon for an Iteration and then select *Start* from the menu options to start the Iteration.
* *Past Iterations* are Iterations that have ended.
* *Future Iterations* are Iterations that have not been started yet. This category can be used to plan Iterations for the future.

The *Board* view shows a Kanban-based view of the selected Iteration's Work Items. Work Items are categorized based on their current status, such as *new* for newly created Work Items, *open* for scoped Work Items, *in progress* for Work Items currently in development, *resolved* for completed Work Items, and *closed* for Work Items that are completed and verified.

Use these views in the *Plan* tab to modify Work Items and Iterations, assign Work Items to Iterations, and organize and monitor Work Items during their life cycle.

[#ordering_and_monitoring_work_items]
== Ordering and Monitoring Work Items

The Planner's *Backlog* option displays a list view of the Work Items. Use this view to plan and organize your work by ordering the Work Items based on the status or priority.

The *Backlog* option can display the list of Work Items in one of two ways:

* A *Hierarchy*, which is a tree-view format where child Work Items are displayed when you expand the parent Work Item.

* A *Flat* list, where all the Work Items display in a single list.

You can order the Work Items in the list based on your requirement as follows:

* In the menu:Plan[Backlog] view, select a Work Item and then drag and drop it in the required order. Alternatively, click the options (image:kabob.png[title="More"]) icon and then select *Move to Top* or *Move to Bottom*  to quickly move a Work Item to the top or bottom of the backlog.

The menu:Plan[Board] view displays a visual representation of the progress status of your Work Items. Based on their status, the Work Items are sorted into swim-lanes  as *new*, *open*, *in progress*, *resolved*, or *closed*. Use this view to view or change your Work Item status by dragging and dropping each Work Item from one swim-lane to another as required.

[#filtering_work_items]
== Filtering Work Items

The menu:Plan[Backlog] view can filter Work Items to display more relevant results. Use the *Select* drop-down menu to filter and display relevant Work Items by filtering based on:

* *Assignee*: Select an assignee from the *Filter by assignee* drop-down list to display Work Items assigned to a particular user.

* *Area*: Select an area from the *Filter by area* drop-down list to display Work Items belonging to a particular Area.

* *Workitem Type*: Select a Work Item Type from the *Filter by workitemtype* drop-down list to display Work Items belonging to a particular Work Item Type.

Similarly, you can filter Work Items in the menu:Plan[Board] view based on *Assignee* or *Area* using the *Select* drop-down list.

Use the menu:Plan[Board] view to select a required Work Item Type in the *Currently showing* drop-down list to view Work Items for a specific Work Item Type.
