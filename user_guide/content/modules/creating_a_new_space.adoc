= Creating a New Collaboration Space

To start a new project, users must create a new Collaboration Space. Each Space includes a team of users in various roles as well as unique <<about_work_items,Work Items>> and <<about_iterations,Iterations>> used to effectively manage the new project.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have <<logging_into_red_hat_openshift_io,Logged in to {osio-link}>> with a valid user account.

.Procedure

. In your {osio-link} home page, click your username in the top left corner of the screen.

. In the drop down menu, click *Create space*.

. Add a unique name for the new space in the *Name* field.

. Select a *Template* type from the drop-down menu. The four options are:
.. *Agile* - Your space is centered around Agile-based plannning.
.. *Scrum* - Your space includes an iterative and incremental Agile-based development framework. This option is similar to the **Agile** option but with more specific planning and development tracking.
.. *Issue Tracking* - Your space is based on an issue tracking development methodology. This option is ideal for teams interested in primarily tracking issues and Tasks and resolving them.
.. *Scenario Driven Planning* - Your space is based on Scenarios, which are real-world problems from the user's point of view. The Scenarios deliver Value Propositions and are realized via (user) Experiences.

. Click *Create Space* to create your new space.

. The *How would you like to get started?* dialog box appears and offers the following options:
