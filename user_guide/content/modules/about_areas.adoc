= About Areas

*Areas* are used to organize related <<about_work_items,Work Items>> into groups to distinguish between different types or functionalities that are being worked on within a <<about_collaboration_spaces,Collaboration Space>>.

A Space can also include multiple Areas. As an example, your Collaboration Space represents your software project, and each Area tracks various components attached to the Space.

Each Area can have multiple child Areas, which represents larger components for your software project including multiple smaller components.
