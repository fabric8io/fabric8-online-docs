= Cleaning your OpenShift Online account

{osio} generates artifacts within five projects (Kubernetes namespaces) in OpenShift Online. See <<viewing_projects_oso>> for details. This section describes how to reset your OpenShift Online account, which can serve two purposes:

Freeing resources used by tutorials:: After you create the <<hello_world_developers,Vert.X>> and <<spring_boot_quickstart_tutorial,Spring Boot HTTP>> quickstart projects, the limited resources available in the OpenShift Online Free Tier are nearly exhausted. You can reset your {osio} and Openshift Online account resources to start afresh.

General troubleshooting:: If your OpenShift.io environment is in a state where you find it difficult or impossible to move forward, you can reset your environment to start afresh.

. After the environment is successfully erased, the success page displays:

image::status_success.png[Success]
+
. Click the check-mark icon on the top right side of the page to see the *Jenkins* and *Che* status. Allow several minutes for this to load. When all the status indicators are green (see screen capture), you can use your {osio} account again. If the status indicators are not green after several minutes, see <<confirming_che_jenkins_status>> for troubleshooting information.

NOTE: The version numbers for Che and Jenkins in the screen capture are for illustration purposes and may not be the most recent versions. See <<confirming_che_jenkins_status>> for details.

After completing these steps, your {osio} and OpenShift Online account resources are reset and ready for use with a new project.
