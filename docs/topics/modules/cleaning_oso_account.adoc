= Cleaning your OpenShift Online account

{osio} generates artifacts within five projects (Kubernetes namespaces) in OpenShift Online. See link:getting-started-guide.html#viewing_projects_oso[Viewing projects in OpenShift Online] for details.

This section describes how to reset your OpenShift Online account, which can serve two purposes:

Freeing resources used by applications:: After you create a quickstart application, the limited resources available in the OpenShift Online Free Tier are nearly exhausted. You can reset your {osio} and Openshift Online account resources to start afresh.


//Freeing resources used by tutorials:: After you create the <<hello_world_developers,Vert.X>> and <<spring_boot_quickstart_tutorial,Spring Boot HTTP>> quickstart projects, the limited resources available in the OpenShift Online Free Tier are nearly exhausted. You can reset your {osio} and Openshift Online account resources to start afresh.

General troubleshooting:: If your OpenShift.io environment is in a state where you find it difficult or impossible to move forward, you can reset your environment to start afresh.
