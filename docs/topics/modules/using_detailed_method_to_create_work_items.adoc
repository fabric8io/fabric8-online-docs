. Click the desired Work Item type.

. In the new Work Item form:

.. Assign an <<about_areas,Area>> to the Work Item from the `Area` field drop-down list and click &#10003; to save the change. By default, the name of your workspace is set as the _Root Area_ and is displayed as one of the options in the drop-down list.

.. Assign a relevant <<about_iterations,Iteration>> to the Work Item from the `Iteration` drop-down list and click &#10003; to save. By default, the name of your workspace is set as the _Root Iteration_ and is displayed as one of the options in the drop-down list.
