= Configuring your Che workspace

After your Che workspace loads, you can see your project code listed in the *Projects Explorer* panel, in the upper-left side of the screen. You must now ensure the following prerequisites are met before you start using the workspace to edit the codebase:

// for user-guide
ifeval::["{context}" == "user-guide"]
.Prerequisites

* Add a new or existing codebase to {osio}.
* Create a Che workspace for your target codebase.

.Procedure
endif::[]

. Ensure Git commands are available:
.. Click *Git* in the workspace menu to ensure that all the listed commands (except *Initialize Repository*) are available.

+
.. If they are not available, reload the workspace browser tab.

. Configure your project for Maven:
.. In the *Projects Explorer* panel, click your project name to select it.
.. From the menu options at the top of the page, click *Project*, and then select *Update Project Configuration*.

+
.. In the displayed *Project Configuration* window, select *Maven* and click btn:[Save].
+

+
.. Click the *run* option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). Maven then downloads the required dependencies, compiles the application, and starts the _verticle_ (Vert.x uses this name for deployed code). For Vert.x projects, this also sets up the server and hot deploy options. The hot deploy option automatically updates the application when you make a change.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the *Run* command macro is not defined, it displays the *Create run command* option instead of *Run*:

See <<create_run_command_macro>> for instructions on setting up a run command.
====

. A *run* terminal appears at the bottom pane of the Che workspace. When the `mvn{nbsp}build` command finishes executing, the *run* view displays the *Succeeded in Deploying verticle* message:
+
image::{context}_deployed_verticle.png[Successfully deployed verticle]
+
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the *run* view to see your application running in Che.
+
image::{context}_run_proj.png[Run project link]
+
// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]
. Enter a name in the *Name* field and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.
+
image::{context}_john.png[Testing the application]
endif::[]

// for importing-existing-project
ifeval::["{context}" == "importing-existing-project"]
. Enter a name in the *Name* field and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.

This is the same version of the application that the pipeline deployed to *Stage* and you subsequently promoted to *Run*. The URL for this build of the application is different from the URLs used by OpenShift Online for *Stage* and *Run*. This is your private sandbox hosted within Che. You can still share this URL with others and interactively debug the application while they run it in their browser.
