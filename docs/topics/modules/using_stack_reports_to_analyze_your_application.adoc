= Using stack reports to analyze your application

{osio} includes a stack report feature that analyzes and reports information about a project's application stack and dependency libraries. Stack reports recommend alternate and additional components to improve your application and help you make informed choices about the code and libraries used in your project.

{osio} generates a stack report for your project when the pipeline build starts the *Build Release* stage. To view the stack report for your quickstart application:

. Return to your space dashboard in the {osio} browser tab. The *Stack Report Recommendations* panel in the dashboard shows a summary of the stack report.

. Click *View complete stack report* to view the detailed stack report. The detailed stack report provides information about *Security Issues*, *Licenses*, *Insights*, and *Dependency Details* for your stack.

+
. Click each of the cards to view the following detailed information:
+
* *Security Issues* lists dependencies with known security vulnerabilities and the relevant Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information.
* *Licenses* lists dependencies with license conflicts and unknown licenses and suggests alternate dependencies to resolve the conflicts.
* *Insights* identifies dependencies that do not work well with the stack and recommends alternate dependencies for them. In addition, it recommends companion dependencies to enhance your stack. For this example, the stack report recommends companion dependencies that augment your development stack.
* *Dependency Details* lists all the  dependencies in your stack, flags security, usage, and license issues for them, and suggests replacements for dependencies with issues.

For further information about the stack report, see link:user-guide.html#interpreting_stack_report[interpreting your stack report].

. In the *Companion Dependency Details* section, click *Create work item* to add an auto-populated work item to the planner.

You have now learned how the stack report provides detailed information about your stack and its dependencies, and how it suggests alternate and additional dependencies you can add to your stack to improve your application and make it more secure.
