= Committing and pushing changes to GitHub

After making the required changes to your code, commit and push the modifications to your project GitHub repository.

IMPORTANT: Before committing your changes, ensure that your project pipeline build has completed (that is, the build has been promoted and is at the *Rollout to Run* stage). See <<approving_build_pipeline>> for instructions.
