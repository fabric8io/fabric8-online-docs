= Changing the quickstart code

To change your project code and preview the results:

. In your Che workstation *Projects Explorer* view, navigate to the following file: `src` > `main` > `Java` > `io.openshift.booster` > `HttpApplication.java`.
+

+
. Find the following line in the file, which is the template for API's returned message in the application:
+
[source,java]
----
protected static final String template = "Hello, %s!";
----
+
. Change *Hello* to *Hello from Che* in the line.
+
[source,java]
----
protected static final String template = "Hello from Che, %s!";
----
+
The workspace automatically saves your changes.

. To test your changes:

** If you already ran the application earlier as instructed in <<configuring_your_che_workspace-hello-world>>, your changes are instantly implemented. Maven uses the Vert.X hot deploy feature to automatically update the application when you make a change. Return to the browser tab running the application and skip the rest of this step.

** If you have not run the application already as instructed in <<configuring_your_che_workspace-hello-world>>:

*** Click the *run* option (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). The following message displays when the run process completes:
+
----
INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
----
+
*** Click the blue preview URL at the top of the *run* view to see your application.
+

+
. Add a name in the *Name* field and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application. The displayed message shows the amended text template.

You have now learned how the workspace automatically saves and applies your changes.
