= Changing the quickstart code

To change your project code and preview the results:

. In your Che workstation *Projects Explorer* view, navigate to the following file: `src` > `main` > `conf` > `application.yml`.

+
. Change the following line in the file, which is the template for API's returned message in the application:
+
[source,java]
----
message: "Hello %s from the local configuration!"
----
+
. Change the greeting message and then save your changes.
+
[source,java]
----
message: "Hello from Che, %s !"
----
+
. Click the stop button at the top of the workspace to stop the application running.

NOTE: If you already ran the application earlier as instructed in <<running_your_project-hello-world>>, your changes are instantly implemented. Maven uses the Vert.X hot deploy feature to automatically update the application when you make a change. Return to the browser tab running the application and skip the rest of this step.
+
. Add a name in the *Name* field and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application. The displayed message shows the amended text template.

You have now learned how the workspace automatically saves and applies your changes.
