Advanced users can change the settings for their project pipeline builds in OpenShift Online. For most users, we do not recommend changing the default values {ct} sets up.

.Procedure

. At the top of the page, click *Create* and then click *Pipelines* to view the pipeline builds for your project.
. Click *Edit Pipeline* for the target pipeline build.

+
WARNING: {ct} sets up the required default options for your pipeline build. We do not recommended changing these default settings.
+
. In this page, you can edit the following attributes for your build pipelines:
.. Use the *Source Configuration* section to edit your project Git Repository URL.
.. Use the *Jenkinsfile Type* option to select the source of your Jenkinsfile for the build.
.. Use the *Jenkinsfile Source Path* option to provide a relative path to your Jenkinsfile.
. When ready, click btn:[Save] to save your changes and return to the {ct} browser tab.

[NOTE]
====
If your pipeline build does not start for more than ten minutes, you can manually start a pipeline build using the instructions at <<pipeline_build_failure>>.
