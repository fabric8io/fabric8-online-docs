Advanced users can change the settings for their project pipeline builds in OpenShift Online. For most users, we do not recommend changing the default values {osio} sets up.

.Procedure

. Navigate to your space dashboard.
. Click the *Pipelines* link to view the `Pipelines` page, which lists all the pipeline builds for your project.

WARNING: {osio} sets up the required default options for your pipeline build. We do not recommended changing these default settings.

. In this page, you can edit the following attributes for your build pipelines:
.. Use the *Source Configuration* section to edit your project Git Repository URL.
.. Use the *Jenkinsfile Type* option to select the source of your Jenkinsfile for the build.
.. Use the *Jenkinsfile Source Path* option to provide a relative path to your Jenkinsfile.
. When ready, click btn:[Save] to save your changes and return to the {osio} browser tab.
