NOTE: If your Remote Debugger connection fails, restart your browser and try again.
+
. Click btn:[Terminal] to view the terminal tab.
. Run the following command to start debugging:
+
```
curl localhost:8080/api/goodbye
```

You can now review variables in the `Debug` tab. You can also use the `Resume`, `Step Into`, `Step Over`, and `Step Out` option during the debugging process.
