= Staging a Pipeline

In a build pipeline, *Stage* and *Run* are individual OpenShift projects. `Stage` is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and staged on `Run`.

The new build pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 of your new project into *Stage* and then, after user approval, to *Run*.
