= Staging a Pipeline

In a build pipeline, _Stage_ and _Run_ are individual OpenShift projects. _Stage_ is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and staged on _Run_.

The new build pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 of your new project into _Stage_ and then, after user approval, to _Run_.
