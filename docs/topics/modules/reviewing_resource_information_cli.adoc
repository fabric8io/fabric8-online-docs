= Reviewing the resource information using the `oc` tool

You can also monitor the quota usage of your OpenShift Online account using the OpenShift command line interface (`oc`) tool:

. Navigate to link:https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/console/[console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/console] in your browser.
. In the OpenShift console, click the (*?*) icon and select *Command Line Tools* from the displayed options.

+
. Use the instructions and download links from the *Command Line Tools* page for your operating system and install `oc` tools.
. In your computer terminal (not the *Terminal* tab for your workspace), run the following command and enter your OpenShift Online login credentials when prompted.
+
----
oc login https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/
----
+
When logged in, the terminal displays a list of your OpenShift Online projects:
+

+
. Use the following command during and after using the new pod in OpenShift to monitor and compare resource usage:
+
----
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n USERNAME-stage
----
+
An example of the output for this command is as follows:
+
----
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: "1"
    limits.memory: 512Mi
----

. Follow the instructions in <<reducing_hello_world_memory_usage>> and <<commiting_pushing_changes_git-hello-world>> and then resume the next steps here. This allows you to view your memory quota details before and after optimizing the memory usage and compare the two results.

. Click btn:[Create] and then btn:[Pipelines] to view the new pipeline build. Committing and pushing your new YAML file triggers a new pipeline build for your {osio} project. Proceed to the next step when the pipeline build rolls out to *Stage*:

+
. In your terminal window, use the same command again to see the change in memory usage:
+
----
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n USERNAME-stage
----
+
An example of the output for this command after committing the YAML file is as follows:
+
----
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: 488m
    limits.memory: 250Mi
