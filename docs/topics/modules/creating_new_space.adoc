= Creating a new space

In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new space with a unique name.

You can then add collaborators, plan your work using work items and iterations, and create or import codebases within the space.

+
.. If your browser session is already logged in to a GitHub account, {osio} uses it for the GitHub connection step. If not, you are prompted to add your GitHub credentials to connect the account to {osio}. When the accounts are connected, the {osio} home page view displays.
.  Click btn:[Create a space] again.
