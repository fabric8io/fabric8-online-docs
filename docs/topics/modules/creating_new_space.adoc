= Creating a new space

// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]
In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new space. You can then add users as collaborators for the space and all the work is tracked within the space using work items. Each space must have a unique name.

. Use the drop-down menu for the *Development Process* field to select a template for your new space. For this example, keep the default option for this field.

// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]
. In the dialog box, type *myspace* as the unique name for your space and click btn:[Ok].
