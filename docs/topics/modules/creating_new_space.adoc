= Creating a new space

In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new space. You can then add users as collaborators for the space and all the work is tracked within the space using work items. Each space must have a unique name.

== Procedure

Create a new space as follows:

. In the {osio} home page, click btn:[Create a space].

If your account has an existing space, click *+* to create an additional space instead:

// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]

. If this is the first space you are creating with your {osio} account, a message about connecting to GitHub appears. To connect your GitHub account to {osio}:

.. Click btn:[Connect to GitHub].

.. If your broswer session is already logged in to a GitHub account, {osio} uses it for the GitHub connection step. If not, you are prompted to add your GitHub credentials to connect the account to {osio}.

. When the accounts are connected, the {osio} dashboard view displays. Click btn:[Create a space] again.
endif::[]
+
. Use the drop-down menu for the *Development Process* field to select a template for your new space. For this example, keep the default option for this field.

. In the dialog box, type *myspace* as the unique name for your space and click btn:[Ok].
