= Creating a new space

In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new space with a unique name.

You can then add collaborators, plan your work using work items and iterations, and create or import codebases within the space.

+
.. If your browser session is already logged in to a GitHub account, {osio} uses it for the GitHub connection step. If not, you are prompted to add your GitHub credentials to connect the account to {osio}. When the accounts are connected, the {osio} home page view displays.

. Click btn:[Create a space] again.

+
// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]
. Use the *Development Process* drop-down list to select a template for your new space. For this example, select the *Agile* development process.
. In the dialog box, type *myspace* as the unique name for your space and click btn:[Ok].

// for user-guide
ifeval::["{context}" == "user-guide"]
. Use the *Development Process* drop-down list to select a template for your new space. You can select *Scenario Driven Development* or the *Agile* template. For this example, keep the default option for this field.
+
NOTE: The *Development Process* you select while creating your space determines the guided work item type hierarchy in planner and the available work item types to plan your development work.

. In the dialog box, type a unique name for your space and click btn:[Ok].
