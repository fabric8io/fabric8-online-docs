= Tree view of work items
The tree view is the default view of the planner. It displays the list of work items along with their parent and child work item links in a hierarchical structure, providing you the context of the work item in relation to the broader project goals.

It ensures your features and tasks have appropriate parent experiences or value propositions associated with them, limiting the chance of feature creep in your development work. This enables you to plan and take up work items focused on delivering actual customer value.

The tree view helps you create appropriate child work items based on the guided work item type planning hierarchy, aiding better planning, prioritizing, and execution.

You can view, track, and plan your work items along with their parent-child links using the tree view as follows:

NOTE: Ensure that the *Show Tree* check box is selected.

. Click *Plan* and then *Backlog*. The *Scenarios* for your space are displayed by default in a tree hierarchy.
. Expand the work items to see the child *Experiences* and *Requirements* type work items associated to them.
