= Editing the quickstart code

.Prerequisites

* Add a new or existing codebase to {osio}.
* Create a Che workspace for your target codebase.
* Click the *run* option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]) to start running your project code. This allows the hot deploy feature to automatically save and deploy your changes.

.Procedure

To edit your project's code and preview the results:

. In your Che workstation *Projects Explorer* view, double click folder and file names to navigate to the target file you want to edit.

+
. In the file, make the desired changes to the code. The Che workspace automatically saves your changes.

. To test your changes, click the blue preview URL at the top of the *run* view to see your application in a new browser tab.

NOTE: If you already ran the application earlier as instructed in <<configuring_your_che_workspace-user-guide>>, your changes are instantly implemented. Maven uses the Vert.X hot deploy feature to automatically update the application when you make a change. Return to the browser tab running the application and skip the rest of this step.

You have now learned how the workspace automatically saves and applies your changes.
