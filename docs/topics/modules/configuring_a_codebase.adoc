= Configuring a Codebase

After adding a Collaboration Space, you can add a codebase from GitHub and set up a pipeline to build the code.

.Prerequisites

* Create a Collaboration Space. See <<creating_a_new_space>> for instructions.

.Procedure

. Click *Analyze* at the top of the screen to view the Collaboration Space's dashboard.

. The *Codebases* view displays the following options:

 * If codebases are already added to the Collaboration Space, the added codebases are listed and a btn:[+] icon displays at the top right of the view to import more codebases.

 * If no codebases are added, two buttons display:

.. btn:[Add Codebase] to manually add a codebase.

.. btn:[Import Codebase] to add an existing codebase.
