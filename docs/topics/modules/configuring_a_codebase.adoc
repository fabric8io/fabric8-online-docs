= Configuring a codebase

After creating a space, you can add a codebase from GitHub and set up a pipeline to build the code.

.Prerequisites

* Create a space. See <<creating_new_space-user-guide>> for instructions.

.Procedure

. Click *Analyze* at the top of the screen to view the dashboard for your space.

. The *Codebases* section displays the following options:

 * If you already have codebases in your space, they are listed and you can use the btn:[+] icon at the upper-right of the section to import more codebases.

 * If there are no codebases in your space, you can:

.. use btn:[Add Codebase] to manually add a codebase.

.. use btn:[Import Codebase] to add an existing codebase.
