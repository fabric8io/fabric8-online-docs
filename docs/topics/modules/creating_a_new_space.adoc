= Creating a new space

To start working with a new project, create a new space. Each space includes a team of users in assigned roles as well as unique <<about_work_items,Work Items>> and <<about_iterations,Iterations>> used to manage the new project.

.Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have <<logging_into_red_hat_openshift_io,logged in to {osio-link}>>.

.Procedure

. On your {osio-link} home page, click your user name in the upper-left corner of the screen.
. Select *Create space* from the drop-down menu.
. In the *Name* field, add a unique name for the new space.
. From the *Template* drop-down list, select *Scenario Driven Planning*. This template creates spaces based on Scenarios, which are real-world problems from the user's point of view. The Scenarios deliver Value Propositions and are realized through (user) Experiences.
//. Select a *Template* type from the drop-down menu. The available options are:
//.. *Agile* - Your space is centered around Agile-based planning.
//.. *Scrum* - Your space includes an iterative and incremental Agile-based development framework. This option is similar to the **Agile** option but with more specific planning and development tracking.
//.. *Issue Tracking* - Your space is based on an issue tracking development methodology. This option is ideal for teams interested in primarily tracking issues and Tasks and resolving them.
//.. *Scenario Driven Planning* - Your space is based on Scenarios, which are real-world problems from the user's point of view. The Scenarios deliver Value Propositions and are realized based on (user) Experiences.

. Click btn:[Create] to create your new space. The *How would you like to get started?* dialog box displays the following options:

* *<<importing_existing_code,Import existing code>>*: Import existing code into the new space and set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline using OpenShift Online and Jenkins.

* *<<creating_new_project-user-guide_spaces,Create a new Quickstart project>>*: Use wizards to automatically set up your development environment and quickly create projects by using the desired tools.

* btn:[No thanks, take me to the new space dashboard]: Go to your new space dashboard to begin working in the space.
