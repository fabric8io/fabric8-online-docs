= About codebases

After creating a space, {osio} enables you to create a new application codebase or import an existing codebase from GitHub and set up pipelines to build the code. These codebases are a generic representation of a project's code.

When you create a new application using the quickstart wizard, {osio} creates a new code repository for your codebase and stores it in GitHub. {osio} also maintains additional metadata for version control of your project code.
// In the future additional git hosts and non-git options for version control may be supported.
