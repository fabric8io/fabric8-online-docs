= About codebases

When you create a new project using the quickstart wizard, {osio} creates a new code repository for your project and stores it in GitHub. {osio} also maintains additional metadata for version control of your project code. {osio} codebases are a generic representation of a project's code.

Currently, codebases in {osio} are GitHub code repositories. In the future, {osio} may support additional git hosts and even non-git options for version control.
