= Using analytics in the development stage

{osio} provides an integrated development environment in the form of an Eclipse Che workspace to develop your codebase.

{osio} analytics engine analyzes your stack and its dependencies at the development stage within your Che workspace. It flags dependencies with security vulnerabilities and suggests secure, alternate versions to replace them while you develop your application codebase. You can use this analysis to develop a secure codebase with appropriate dependencies.

.Prerequisite

. <<creating_che_workspace-user-guide,Create a Che workspace>> to develop your stack
. <<running_your_project_in_the_che_workspace-user-guide,Run your application in the Che workspace>>

.Procedure

You can access inputs from {osio} analytics within the Che IDE as follows:

. In your Che workspace, open the manifest file of your project, for example, `pom.xml` for a Maven Stack, `package.json` for NPM, or `requirements.txt` for Python.
. Make modifications to your code.   {osio} analyzes the stack, flags the dependency if it has any security vulnerabilities, and suggests an alternate secure version.
. If you see an error icon (image:che_cve_issue.png[title="CVE Flag"]) move the mouse pointer over the icon to see the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) for the flagged dependency and the suggested alternate version.

. Update the dependencies to the suggested version.
