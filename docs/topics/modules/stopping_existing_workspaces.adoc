= Stopping existing workspaces

At this point in the tutorial, we are going to create a workspace for the new SpringBoot project. However, the OpenShift Online Free Tier supports one running workspace at a time and the workspace we created for the Hello World project can still be running. Use the following instructions to ensure that the old workspace is stopped before creating a new workspace for your SpringBoot project:

[discrete]
== Procedure

. In the dashboard of your space, click *Create*.
. In the *Codebases* view, click btn:[Open] next to the workspace of your earlier project. Allow several minutes for the project to load.

.. Alternatively, within the target workspace:
... On the left of the *Workspace* menu item, click *>*. The Che dashboard displays a list of all your workspaces in a separate tab. Use this dashboard to track your workspaces.

Your old workspace resources are now reclaimed in your OpenShift Online account. You can now return to the workspace view in {osio} and create a workspace for your SpringBoot project.
