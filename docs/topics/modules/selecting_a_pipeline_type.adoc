= Selecting a pipeline type

When creating a new project using the Quickstart wizard, three types of Maven-based pipelines are available for your new project:

1. *Release* is the basic option. After creating the pipeline, this option runs an integration test in the *Test* environment but does not stage the results.

2. *Release and Stage* stages the new version of your project in the *Stage* environment after running integration tests.

3. *Release, Stage, Approve and Promote* stages your project in the *Stage* environment and then requires manual approval to promote the changes to the *Run* environment.

== Dashboard Deployments view

Depending on which of the three options was selected for your project, the *Deployments* section of the {osio} dashboard displays the version of the project and which stage type each version currently includes.

For example, for the *Release* option, the *Deployments* section of the {osio} dashboard only shows the name of your project because there is no staging required.

For the *Release and Stage* option, the dashboard displays the version and the *Stage* label because the application is staged.

For the *Release, Stage, Approve and Promote* option, once you promote a version of the project, the dashboard displays both the *Stage* and *Run* environment versions.

== Deployment information

Click *Deployments* on the dashboard to view the detailed *Deployments* screen. This view also displays different types of information depending on the type of pipeline selected for your project.

For the *Release* pipeline, the *Stage* and *Run* details contain no information because this pipeline type does not use these environments.

For the *Release and Stage* option, the *Stage* details are available, including resource usage and the version of the project.

For the *Release, Stage, Approve and Promote* pipeline type, the details for both *Stage* and *Run* are listed, along with resource and pod usage.

Using the *Release, Stage, Approve and Promote* pipeline option is recommended because this gives you the most information and control over your project.
