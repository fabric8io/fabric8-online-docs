= Selecting a pipeline type

When <<creating_new_project-user-guide>> using the quickstart wizard, three types of Maven-based pipelines are available for your new project:

image::user-guide_select_pipeline.png[Select a pipeline]

. *Build Release, Integration Test, Rollout to Stage, Approve, Rollout to Run* is the recommended option for most projects. It provides an end to end pipeline that moves your application through all the stages of application development, that is, build your source code, test your changes, rollout to the *Stage* environment, review, manually approve, and promote the changes to the *Run* environment.

. *Build Release, Integration Test* is the most basic option. After creating the pipeline, this option runs an integration test in the *Test* environment but does not stage the results.

. *Build Release, Integration Test, Rollout to Stage* stages the new version of your project in the *Stage* environment after running integration tests.


//== Dashboard deployments view

//Depending on which of the three options was selected for your project, the *Deployments* section of the {osio} dashboard displays the version of the project and which stage type each version currently includes.

//For example, for the *Release* option, the *Deployments* section of the {osio} dashboard only shows the name of your project because there is no staging required.

//For the *Release and Stage* option, the dashboard displays the version and the *Stage* label because the application is staged.

//For the *Release, Stage, Approve and Promote* option, once you promote a version of the project, the dashboard displays both the *Stage* and *Run* environment versions.

== Deployment information

Click *Deployments* on the dashboard to view the detailed *Deployments* screen. This view also displays different types of information depending on the type of pipeline selected for your project.

For the *Release* pipeline, the *Stage* and *Run* details contain no information because this pipeline type does not use these environments.

For the *Release and Stage* option, the *Stage* details are available, including resource usage and the version of the project.

For the *Release, Stage, Approve and Promote* pipeline type, the details for both *Stage* and *Run* are listed, along with resource and pod usage.

Using the *Release, Stage, Approve and Promote* pipeline option is recommended because this gives you the most information and control over your project.
