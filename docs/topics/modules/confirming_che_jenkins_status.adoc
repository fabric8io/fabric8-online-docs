After <<connecting_to_oso>>, you must ensure that the Che and Jenkins tenant services are provisioned and running. This process requires several minutes after completing the following steps:

. To check the Che and Jenkins status, click the check mark icon (image:check_icon.png[title="Check Icon"]) at the upper-right of the page.

====
The version numbers for Jenkins in the screen captures are for illustration purposes and can be outdated.

Use the following file to see the most recent version for Jenkins and compare it to the version displayed in {osio} for your account.

//* Che version information: link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant/blob/master/CHE_VERSION[CHE_VERSION]
* Jenkins version information: link:https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant/blob/master/JENKINS_VERSION[JENKINS_VERSION]

* If the tenant status indicates that all services are ready (see screen capture for an example), Che and Jenkins are provisioned and ready for use.

* If the Jenkins status is gray (see screen capture for example), this service is still loading. Allow several minutes for all services to either display as green (ready) or red (failed).

.. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click btn:[Update tenant]. This initiates an update in your OpenShift Online account. Allow approximately five minutes for the version numbers in the status display to refresh. When the update is complete, the green check marks appear with the updated version numbers for Che and Jenkins.
