= Confirming Che and Jenkins status

After <<connecting_to_oso>>, you must ensure that the Che and Jenkins tenant services are provisioned. This process requires several minutes after completing the following steps:

IMPORTANT: Due to a system upgrade, the tenant status does not currently list Che. The current workaround for this is that users can safely ignore this and continue using {osio}.

. To check the Che and Jenkins status, click the check mark icon (image:check_icon.png[title="Check Icon"]) at the upper-right of the page.

* If the Che and Jenkins status indicates that all services are ready (see screen capture), Che and Jenkins are provisioned and ready for use.

* If the Che and Jenkins status is gray (see screen capture), the services are loading. Wait several minutes until the services are either green (ready) or red(failed).

.. On your {osio} home page, click your name on the top right corner of the screen.
.. In the drop down options, click btn:[Profile].
.. On the profile page, click btn:[Update Profile].
.. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click btn:[Update tenant]. This initiates an update in your OpenShift Online account. Allow approximately five minutes for the version numbers in the status display to refresh. When the update is complete, the green check marks appear with the updated version numbers for Che and Jenkins.
