. Enter a *Name* for your new iteration.

. Optionally, create a parent link to another iteration by selecting the parent iteration from the *Parent Iteration* drop-down list. By default, the name of your space is set as the parent iteration.

. Add a *Description* for the new iteration.

. Add a *Start Date* and *End Date* for your new iteration.

. The iteration automatically becomes *Active* if the current date falls within the start and end date range. Alternatively, if required, toggle the *Force Active* switch to *ON* to force start the iteration.
NOTE: You can have multiple iterations active at the same time.

. Click btn:[Create] to create the new iteration.

Your new iteration appears under *Iterations* in the left pane. It is tagged as *Active* if the current date falls within the start and end date range or if you force-activated it.
