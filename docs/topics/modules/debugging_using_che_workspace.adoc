= Debugging using your Che workspace

After creating your {osio} project, you can debug your application code in the Che workspace. This exercise is optional but recommended as an introduction to debugging code in {osio}.


[discrete]
== Procedure

. Return to your project Che workspace browser tab.
. If the `HttpApplication.java` file is not already loaded, double-click it in your file explorer view (`src` > `main` > `Java` > `io.openshift.booster`) to view the contents.
+

+
. In your `HttpApplication.java` file, add a line break between lines 21 and 22, then type `router.` and press kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to see the context-aware assistance.
. Scroll down in the displayed list and select the `get():Route` method. This is the Vert.x Router get method and maps to the HTTP verb GET.
+

+
. Edit the new line to include the `goodbye` endpoint. The following is an example of the completed new line:
+
[source,java]
----
router.get("/api/goodbye").handler(this::goodbye);
----
+
. Add a new line after line 53 and then add the following method for the `goodbye` endpoint:
+
[source,java]
----
private void goodbye(RoutingContext rc) {
  String name = rc.request().getParam("name");
  if (name == null) {
    name = "World";
  }
  JsonObject response = new JsonObject()
    .put("content", "Goodbye " + name);

    rc.response()
      .putHeader(CONTENT_TYPE, "application/json; charset=utf-8")
        .end(response.encodePrettily());
}
----
+
. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
. If your application is already deployed, skip this step. To deploy the application, click the *run* option (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). The following message displays when the run process completes:
+
----
INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
----
+
. In the *Terminal* tab at the bottom of the page, test the new endpoint by typing the following command:
+
----
curl localhost:8080/api/goodbye
----
+
The following result appears if the changes were successful:
+

+
. In the *EXEC* bar on the top of the workspace page, click the stop button (a blue square icon) to stop the current run process.
+

+
When stopped, the square icon becomes a circular arrow (image:run_stopped.png[title="Run Stopped"]).
