= Viewing resource usage

An {osio} account with OpenShift Online provides two pods for your projects. To view how much of these resources are currently used in {osio}, navigate to the *Resources* page as follows:

. Click your username in the upper right corner of the {osio} page and click *Settings*.

. In the menu options, click *Resources*.

In the displayed resources page, you can see how much of the available resources have been used so far.

If you have not added any projects to your {osio} account, the page shows all resources as available:

If you have created one project, which is not pushed to *Run* yet, the page shows that some of the resources for *Stage* are in use.
