= Viewing resource usage

An {osio} account with OpenShift Online provides two pods for your projects. To view how many of these resources are currently used in {osio}, navigate to the *Resources* page as follows:

. Click your username in the upper right corner of the {osio} page and select *Settings*.

If you have not added any projects to your {osio} account, the page shows all resources as available:

+
If you have created one project, which is not pushed to *Run* yet, the page shows that some of the resources for *Stage* are in use.

See <<reviewing_detailed_resource_information-user-guide>> to view further details on resource usage.

After you create two projects, the two pods allocated to an OpenShift Online account have been used. Use this page to check if you have resources remaining because future builds may fail if the required resources are not available. See <<resetting_your_osio_account, resetting your environment>> to reclaim all these resources.
