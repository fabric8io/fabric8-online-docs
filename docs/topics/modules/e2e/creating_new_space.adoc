= Creating a new space

In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new Space. You can then add users as Collaborators for the Space and all the work is tracked within the Space using Work Items. Each Space must have a unique name. Create a new space as follows:

. In the {osio} home page, click btn:[Create a space].
. In the dialog box, type *myspace* as the unique name for your space.

. Use the drop-down menu for the `Templates` field to select a template for your new Space. For this example, select *Scenario Driven Planning* and click btn:[Create].
. The `How would you like to get started?` menu appears for your new space.
