= Stopping Existing Workspaces

Before creating a workspace for your project, stop the workspace for your previous project. Each running workspace uses your OpenShift Online resources. The OpenShift Online Free Tier supports one running workspace at a time. As a result, you must stop running workspaces for older projects each time before creating a new workspace.

Review the workspaces in your OpenShift Online account as follows:

. In your Space's dashboard, click btn:[Create].
. In the `Codebases` view, click btn:[Open] for the older project's workspace. Allow several minutes for the project to load.

. Stop the current workspace in one of two ways:
.. Click btn:[Workspace] from the top of the page and click btn:[Stop].

.. Alternatively, within the target workspace:
... Click *>* next to the `Workspace` menu item on the left side of the workspace.

In the displayed list of all workspaces, a green dot next to the name indicates if a workspace is running.

... For all running workspaces, click the stop icon under `ACTIONS`.

Your old workspace resources are now reclaimed in your OpenShift Online account.
