= Using Work Items

Create a Work Item that tracks changing a string in your Quickstart project. Use the `Planner` to create a new Work Item for your Space as follows:

== Enable Experimental Features

. If you have not enabled `Experimental Features`:
.. Click your name on the top right side of the screen.
.. Click btn:[Profile].
.. Click btn:[Update Profile].
.. In the `Experimental Features` part of the page, read the disclaimer and check the `I agree to the terms above and would like to opt into experimental features` option.

.. Click btn:[Update].

. Click your user name on the top left side of the page.
. Click the name of your new Space from the displayed options to return to that Space's dashboard view.
. At the top of the page, click btn:[Plan] to see the Planner view for your Space.  With experimental features enabled, the Planner view displays a green banner at the top of the page:

. Click `Got it!` in the green banner to dismiss the message.

== Create and Use a New Work Item

. In the Planner's Backlog view, click btn:[Create Work Item] at the bottom of the screen. This is the fastest option to create a new Work Item.

. In the `Work Item Title` text box, type *Add bonjour to the code*.
. In the `Work Item Description` text box, type *Change the greeting in the quickstart code*.
. Click &#10004; to create the Work Item. The new Work Item displays in the Planner view.
