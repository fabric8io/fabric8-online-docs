= Changing the Quickstart's Code

To change your project code and preview the results:

. In your Che workstation `Project Explorer` view, navigate to the following file: `src` > `main` > `Java` > `io.openshift.booster` > `HttpApplication.java`.
+
image::project_dir.png[Project Directory]
+
. Find the following line in the file:
+
```java
protected static final String template = "Hello, %s!";
```
+
. Change *Hello* to *Bonjour* in the line.
+
```java
protected static final String template = "Hello from Che, %s!";
```
+
The workspace automatically saves your changes.

. To test your changes:

** If you already ran the application earlier as instructed in <<prereq_che-hello-world>>, your automatically saved changes are already implemented. Maven uses Vert.x's hot deploy feature to automatically update the application when you make a change. Return to the browser tab running the application and skip to the next step.

** If you have not run the application already as instructed in <<prereq_che-hello-world>>:

*** Click the `run` option (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). The following message displays when the run process completes:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
+
*** Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.
+

+
. Add a string to the text box and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.

You have now learned how the workspace automatically saves and applies your changes.
