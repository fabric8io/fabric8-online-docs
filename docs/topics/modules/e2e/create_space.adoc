= Creating a New Space

In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new Space. You can then add users as Collaborators for the Space and all the work is tracked within the Space using Work Items. Each Space must have a unique name. Create a new space as follows:

. In the {osio} home page, click btn:[Create a space].
. In the dialog box, add a unique name for your space.
. Use the drop-down menu for the `Templates` field to select a template for your new Space. For this example, select *Scenario Driven Planning* and click btn:[Create].
. The `How would you like to get started?` menu appears for your new space. If this menu does not appear automatically, use the following steps:
.. Double-click the name of the relevant Space from the list under `Recent spaces`.
.. In the resulting `Analyze` screen for the Space, click btn:[Add to space] in the top right corner to view the `How would you like to get started?` menu.
