= Prerequisites for Using Your Che Workspace

After your Che workspace has loaded, you can see your project code at the top right side of the screen. You must now ensure the following prerequisites are met before you start using the workspace to edit the codebase:

. *Ensure Git commands are available*:
.. Click `Git` in the workspace menu to ensure that all the listed commands (except `Initialize Repository`) are available.

+
.. If they are not available, reload the workspace browser tab.

. *Configure your project for Maven*:
.. Click your project name to select it.
.. Click the `Project` option from the menu options at the top of the page.
.. Select `Update Project Configuration`.

+
.. In the `Project Configuration` window, select `Maven` and click btn:[Save].
.. Click the `run` option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). Maven then downloads the required dependencies, compiles the application, and starts the `verticle` (Vert.x uses this name for deployed code). For Vert.x projects, this also sets up the server and hot deploy options.
. A run terminal appears at the bottom pane of the Che workspace. When the *mvn build* command finishes executing, the `run` view displays the following message:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
+
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.

+
. Enter a name in the text box and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.

This is the same version of the application that the pipeline deployed to `Stage` and you subsequently promoted to `Run`. The URL for this build of the application is different from the URLs used by OpenShift Online for `Stage` and `Run`. This URL is for your private sandbox hosted within Che. You can still share this URL with others and interactively debug the application while they run it in their browser.
