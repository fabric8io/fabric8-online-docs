= About the Stage and Run Environments

Your {osio} subscription also provides you with an OpenShift Online Starter subscription. This Starter subscription includes two environments named *Stage* and *Run* to deploy your applications. Initially, applications deploy to *Stage*, which is accessible to stakeholders for review using a public URL. If approved and promoted, the application deploys to *Run*, which is similar to a production environment but is another staging area.

The reason *Run* is not named *Production* is that the OpenShift Online Starter subscription does not support running production applications. https://www.openshift.com/pricing/index.html[Purchase an OpenShift Online Pro subscription] to include support for running production applications.

{osio} includes a *Stage* and *Run* environment to allow developers to experience the modern workflow of pushing an application to a staging environment before production. *Run* therefore is a pseudo-production environment for educational purposes.
