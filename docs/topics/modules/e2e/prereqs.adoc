*Browser Requirements:*

. Currently, only Google Chrome can be used with {osio}. Additional browsers will be added here as they are tested.
. Ensure that you run {osio} in Chrome's *Incognito Mode* or as a `Guest` user. This is required because troubleshooting or other functions require clearing your browser's history.

*General Requirements:*

. Ensure that you have a GitHub account.
. Sign up for an OpenShift Online account at https://www.openshift.com/.
. Register to join the {osio} developer preview at https://openshift.io/.
