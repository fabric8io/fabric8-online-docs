** Different versions of your application are deployed to `Stage` and `Run`. Version 1.0.2 of the application is deployed to `Stage` because you have not yet promoted it to `Run`. The older version 1.0.1 is deployed to `Run` because you approved it last time the pipeline build executed.
** The green check marks indicate that both builds are operational.
** The number 1 indicates that each of the application builds is scaled to 1 pod in OpenShift Online. The number of pods indicates the number of running instances of the application.
** The version numbers link to individual running applications. If you mouse over the version numbers, you will see a message about the environments. Click the version numbers to see the relevant application version running in `Stage`. You can share these URLs to compare the old and new versions of the application.
