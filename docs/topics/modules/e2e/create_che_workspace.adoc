[#create_che_workspace-{context}]
= Creating a Che Workspace

Create a new Che workspace for your project:

. In your {osio} space's dashboard, click `Create`.
. In the `Codebases` view, click `Create workspace` for your project.
. When your workspace is ready, click btn:[Open] to view your new workspace.

[WARNING]
====
If a new tab does not appear, do not click `Create Workspace` again because this creates an additional (unnecessary) workspace which wastes your OpenShift Online resources. The new tab does not appear if your browser blocks the pop up that creates this new workspace. To resolve this:

. Click the blocked pop up icon in your browser's URL field.
. Select the `Always allow` option for pop ups from {osio} (see screen capture).

. Click the new workspace URL in the same dialog box to display the new Che workspace in a new tab.
====

When loaded and ready to use, the new Che workspace tab includes your new project's GitHub repository folder in the `Project Explorer` panel.
