= Analyzing Che Dependencies

The Che workspace automatically analyzes dependencies for the code. To see how this analyzer works:

. Return to the Che workspace browser tab.
. In the `Project Explorer` panel, double click the `pom.xml` file.
+
image::pomxml.png[Pom.xml File]
+
. In the file, go to line 43 and add a line break.
. Add the following XML code to the file after the line break:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
  <artifactId>logback-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----
+
. An error icon appears near the line numbers when you add the XML code. Move the mouse pointer over the icon to view the error message (see screen capture).
+

The dependency analyzer displays this error to indicate that the current version (1.1.0) has a CVE issue (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) associated with it. It also recommends using version 1.2.1 instead to fix the problem.
. Update the version in the *<version>* tags of the code to `1.2.1`. The red icon disappears when the version number is updated.

You have now learned how the Che workspace automatically analyzes dependencies for your code and indicates problems and recommends fixes.
