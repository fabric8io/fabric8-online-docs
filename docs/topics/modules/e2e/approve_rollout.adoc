[#approve_rollout]
= Approving the Build Pipeline

Several minutes after starting, your build pipeline is ready to be promoted to `Stage`.

The build pipeline includes steps for a `Stage` build and a `Run` build. `Stage` is a production staging area to review and test changes before they finalizing them and staging the build on `Run`.

To review the final changes in `Stage` and promote them to `Run`:

. From your Space's dashboard, click btn:[Create] from the options at the top of the screen.
. Click btn:[Pipelines].
. Click the icon (image:rollout_icon.png[title="Rollout"]) next to `Rollout to Stage` in the displayed pipeline. OpenShift Online provides this public URL to access the staged Quickstart project. The Vert.x HTTP Booster Quickstart produces a simple API behind a REST endpoint over HTTP with a minimalist user interface.
