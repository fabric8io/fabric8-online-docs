= Ordering and Monitoring Work Items

The `Backlog` displays a list view used to plan your work. You can order Work Items based on their priority, status, and other parameters to organize them.

The `Backlog` displays the list of Work Items as a list where all the Work Items display in a single file.

Click btn:[Plan] to view the Planner. You can order the Work Items in your Space as follows:

* In the btn:[Backlog] view, drag and drop a selected Work Item to reorder them. Alternatively, select btn:[Move to Top] or btn:[Move to Bottom] from the options (image:kabob_white.png[title="Options"]) menu.

The btn:[Board] view displays a visual representation of your Work Item progress. Based on their status, the Work Items are sorted into the _new_, _open_, _in progress_, _resolved_, or _closed_ columns. Use this feature to track and update the status of Work Items as you progress through your task list.

In the btn:[Board] view, you can drag and drop the selected Work Item to the relevant column based on the progress of the Work Item.
