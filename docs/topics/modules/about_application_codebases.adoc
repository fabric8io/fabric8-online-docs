= About application codebases

After creating a space, you can use {ct} to create a new application codebase or import an existing codebase from GitHub and set up pipelines to build the code. These codebases are a generic representation of a project's code.

When you create a new application using the quickstart wizard, {ct} creates a new code repository for your codebase and stores it in GitHub. {ct} also maintains additional metadata for version control of your project code.
// In the future additional git hosts and non-git options for version control may be supported.
