= Monitoring your OpenShift Online quota usage

Monitor your OpenShift Online account's quota usage using the OpenShift CLI (oc) tool:

. Navigate to https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/console/ in your browser.
. In the OpenShift Console, click the btn:[?] icon and select btn:[Command Line Tools] from the displayed options.

+
. Use the instructions and download links from the `Command Line Tools` page for your operating system and install oc tools.
. In your computer's terminal (not the `Terminal` tab for your workspace), run the following command and enter your OpenShift Online login credentials when prompted.
+
```cli
oc login https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/
```
+
When logged in, the terminal displays a list of your OpenShift Online projects:

+
. Use the following command during and after using the new pod in OpenShift to monitor and compare resource usage:
+
```cli
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n USERNAME-stage
```
+
An example of the output for this command is as follows:
+
```cli
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: "1"
    limits.memory: 512Mi
```
+
. Follow the instructions in <<reduce_hello_world_memory_usage>> and then resume the next steps here. This allows you to view your memory quota details before and after optimizing the memory usage and compare the two results.
. Click btn:[Create] and then btn:[Pipelines] to view the new pipeline build. Committing and pushing your new yaml file triggers a new pipeline build for your {osio} project. Proceed to the next step when the pipeline build rolls out to `Stage`:

+
. In your terminal window, use the same command again to see the change in memory usage:
+
```cli
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n USERNAME-stage
```
+
An example of the output for this command after committing the yaml file is as follows:
+
```cli
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: 488m
    limits.memory: 250Mi

```

Optimizing memory usage is important when creating more than one project in {osio}. Each additional project requires an additional share of your OpenShift Online resources. For the OpenShift Online Free Tier, see <<cleaning_up_oso_account>> to reset your OpenShift Online and {osio} accounts after creating two projects.
