= Analyzing stack dependencies within Che

The Che workspace automatically analyzes dependencies for the code while you modify it. To see how this analyzer works:

. Return to the Che workspace browser tab.
. In the file explorer panel, double-click the `pom.xml` file.
+

+
. In the file, go to line 43 and add a line break.
. Modify the file by adding the following XML code to the file after the line break:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
  <artifactId>logback-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----
+
. An error icon appears next to the lines of code you modified. Move the mouse pointer over the icon to view the error message.

+
The error indicates that the dependency analyzer has identified a high Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) score associated with the current version, 1.1.0. It also recommends using an alternate, secure version, 1.2.1, instead to fix the issue.

. Update the version to `1.2.1`. The error icon disappears when the version number is updated.

. Commit these changes to add this dependency to your stack.
