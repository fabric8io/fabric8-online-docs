= Analytics stack report

{osio} includes a stack report feature that analyzes and reports information about a project's application stack and component libraries. This information helps you make informed choices about the code and libraries used in your project.

The stack report is generated during the *Build Release* stage of the build pipeline. To view the stack report for your quickstart application:

. Return to your space dashboard in the {osio} browser tab. The *Stack Report Recommendations* panel in the dashboard shows a summary of the stack report.

. Click *View complete stack report* to view the detailed stack report. The detailed stack report provides information about *Security Issues*, *Licenses*, *Insights*, and *Dependency Details* for your stack.

+
. Click each of the cards to view the following detailed information:
+
* *Security Issues* lists dependencies with known security vulnerabilities and the relevant Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) information.
* *Licenses* lists dependencies with license conflicts and unknown licenses and suggests alternate dependencies to resolve the conflicts.
* *Insights* identifies dependencies that do not work well with the stack and recommends alternate dependencies for them. In addition, it recommends companion dependencies to enhance your stack. For this example, the stack report recommends companion dependencies that augment your development stack.
* *Dependency Details* lists all the  dependencies in your stack, flags security, usage, and license issues for them, and suggests replacements for dependencies with issues.

For further information about the stack report, see link:user-guide.html#interpreting_stack_report[interpreting your stack report].

. In the *Companion Dependency Details* section, click *Create work item* to add an auto-populated work item to the planner.
+
You have now learned how the stack report provides detailed information about your stack and its dependencies, and how it suggests alternate and additional dependencies you can add to your stack to improve your application and make it more secure.

. You have now completed the task, *Use analytics to identify and resolve security and license issues in the application*,  in the *Test Iteration*. Navigate to the *Plan* tab and ensure that you change the state of the work item and its parent feature to *Closed*.

. Also, close the *Test Iteration* using the options (image:kabob.png[title="Options"]) icon next to the iteration as you have now completed all the work items associated with your active iteration.
