= Forking an example repository

In addition to creating projects based on quickstarts, you can also add projects by using the *Import an existing codebase* feature.

== Prerequisites

Reset your {osio} environment by following instructions in <<resetting_your_osio_account>>.


[discrete]
== Procedure

As an example for this tutorial, use our sample repositories in GitHub. Fork one of the following (the examples in this tutorial are for the `vertx-eventbus` repository):

* link:https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus[https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus]
* link:https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-paint[https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-paint]
* link:https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-wiki2[https://github.com/burrsutter/vertx-wiki2]

NOTE: The OpenShift Online Free Tier provides two pods, and each project requires one pod.

While you can import all three projects into {osio} simultaneously, it can result in a 12-15 minute delay. We recommend trying to import the projects one at a time.
