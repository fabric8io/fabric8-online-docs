If you followed the instructions in this document, you have now learned about {osio} and its features. You are now able to:

* Create Spaces for your projects. See <<creating_new_space-hello-world>> for instructions.
* Add code from an existing project to your Space. See <<importing-existing-project>> for instructions.
* Create new projects using the quickstart wizards and test them. See <<hello_world_developers>> for Vert.X project instructions and <<spring_boot_quickstart_tutorial>> for Spring Boot project instructions.
* Create Work Items to track and manage your tasks. See <<creating_using_new_work_item>> for instructions.
* Use the build pipelines to stage reviews in the `Stage` and `Run` environments. See <<working_with_pipelines>> for instructions.
* Create Che workspaces to edit your project code and commit the changes to GitHub. See <<create_che_workspace-hello-world>> and <<commit_push_changes_git-hello-world>> for instructions.
* Optimize the memory usage for your Vert.X and Spring Boot projects to use your OpenShift Online resources more efficiently. See <<optimizing_memory_usage>> and <<reduce_springboot_memory_usage>>.
* Use Stack reports to make improvements to your code. See <<using_stack_reports>> for instructions.
* Debug your code using the Che workspace. See <<debugging_che_workspace>> for instructions.
* Clean up your {osio} account so you can start afresh. See <<cleaning_up_oso_account>> for instructions.

You can now try using what you have learned about {osio} with your own projects. {osio} is currently Early Access only (see <<early-access-program>> for details).
