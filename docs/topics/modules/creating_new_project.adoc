= Creating a new application

After creating a space, {osio} enables you to create a new application codebase or import an existing codebase from GitHub and set up pipelines to build the code. These codebases are a generic representation of a project's code.

When you create an application using the quickstart wizard, {osio} creates a new code repository for your codebase and stores it in GitHub. It also maintains additional metadata for version control of your project code. In the future additional git hosts and non-git options for version control may be supported.

// for spring-boot
ifeval::["{context}" == "spring-boot"]
This section describes the creation of a Spring Boot quickstart application using the {osio} provided codebases. See the <<hello_world_developers,Hello World project>> for an example of a Vert.X application.
endif::[]

When you create a new space, the *Create an Application* wizard to create applications displays. If you closed the wizard earlier, click btn:[Create an Application] in your space dashboard to see the wizard again. Use this wizard to create a new quickstart project as follows:

NOTE: Each quickstart has different requirements to run. We recommend reading the project's README file for details about requirements.

// for hello-world
ifeval::["{context}" == "hello-world"]
. In the *Name your application* field, type `helloworldvertx`.

. Select the *Create a new codebase* radio button and click btn:[Continue].

. Select the mission and runtime for your new project:

.. In the *Choose a mission* section, select the *Externalized Configuration* option.

.. In the *Choose a runtime* section, select *Eclipse Vert.x*.

.. Click the blue downward arrow button to continue.

. The next screen displays a summary of your application options. Scroll down in your browser to view the *Application Information* section. For this example, do not edit these options. If desired, you can change the project name, version, Group ID, which space it is in, and the target environment for your new application at this step.

. Click btn:[Set Up Application] to finalize your choices and create the new application.

. The progress screen displays a confirmation message when your application is ready.
.. Optionally, click the blue link to view your new codebase in your Git provider.
.. When ready, click btn:[View New Application].
