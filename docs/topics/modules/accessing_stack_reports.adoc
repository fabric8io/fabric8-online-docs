{osio} analytics stack report provides information in a condensed way that helps you make informed choices regarding your development stack and its component libraries. It analyzes your stack and recommends alternate and additional components to improve your application.

The stack report is available after the first pipeline build completes. To view the stack report for your quickstart project:

. Return to your space dashboard in the {osio} browser tab. The *Stack Report Recommendations* panel in the dashboard shows a summary of the stack report.
. Click *Show complete stack report* at the bottom of this panel to view the complete report.
