= Working with pipelines

When you create a new Quickstart project, a new build executes. In a build pipeline, <<about_stage_run,*Stage* and *Run*>> are individual OpenShift projects. *Stage* is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and then staged on *Run*.

After you create a new Quickstart project, you can see the new project build pipelines running in the *Applications* panel on your space dashboard:

After several minutes, the status of the pipeline build changes from *New* to *Running*, which indicates that the build has successfully started.

To view your new Quickstart project pipeline:

* After the pipeline status changes to *Running*, click *Pipelines* above the running pipeline status. This page displays all running pipelines for your space.

Your new project build pipeline displays on this page at the *Approve* stage:

For your new Quickstart project, the new build pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 into *Stage* and then, after user approval, it pushes the changes to *Run*.

[NOTE]
====
If your pipeline build does not start for more than ten minutes, you can manually start a pipeline build using the instructions at <<pipeline_build_failure>>.
