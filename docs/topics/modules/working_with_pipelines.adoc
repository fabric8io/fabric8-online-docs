= Working with pipelines

When you create a new quickstart project, a new build executes. In a build pipeline, <<about_stage_run,_Stage_ and _Run_>> are individual OpenShift projects. _Stage_ is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and then staged on _Run_.

//After you create a new Quickstart project, you can see the new project build pipelines running in the *Applications* panel on your space dashboard:

//image::hello-world_applications.png[Applications view]

. At the top of the page, click *Create*.

. In the sub-menu options, click *Pipelines*. The build pipelines for your new application display on this page. Initially, the build status is `No stages have started`.

When the pipeline build is ready, it displays at the *Approve* stage:

For your new quickstart project, the new build pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 into _Stage_ and then, after user approval, it pushes the changes to _Run_.

[NOTE]
====
If your pipeline build does not start for more than ten minutes, you can manually start a pipeline build using the instructions at <<pipeline_build_failure>>.
