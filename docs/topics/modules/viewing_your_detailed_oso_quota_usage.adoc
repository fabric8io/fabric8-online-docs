After committing your changes, view the resource details for your project again in OpenShift Online. Use the following instructions to see these details:

. Click *Create* and then *Pipelines* to view the new pipeline build. Committing and pushing your new YAML file triggers a new pipeline build for your {osio} project. Allow several minutes for the pipeline build to roll out to *Stage*.

. After the pipeline build is ready, return to the OpenShift Online console browser tab to review the optimized memory usage for your Hello World project:

. <<approving_your_application,Promote the application>> to the *Run* environment.
+
You can now compare these details to the details in <<reviewing_detailed_resource_information-{context}>> to see the resource usage improvements.

NOTE: If you have completed these instructions for optimizing your resources but still do not have enough OpenShift Online resources, see <<cleaning_oso_account>> to reset your OpenShift Online and {osio} accounts.

. You have now completed the task, *Optimize {osio} resource usage*,  in the *Test Iteration*. Navigate to the *Plan* tab and ensure that you change the state of the work item to *Closed*.
