. In the top menu bar options, click menu:Run[Terminal] to view the terminal tab.

. Run the following command in the terminal to start debugging:

----
curl localhost:8080/api/goodbye
----

. Click the debug icon (image:debug_icon.png[title="Debug icon"]) at the bottom left corner of the workspace. The `Variables` panel on the bottom right side of the screen lists your debugger variables. 

You can explore the debugger features by using the *Resume*, *Step Into*, *Step Over*, and *Step Out* options during the debugging process. When finished, close the workspace tab and return to the {osio} tab.
