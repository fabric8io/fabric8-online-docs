= About spaces

A _space_ is the first thing a user creates in {osio}. All other elements are created within a space to organize them for each project.

After you create a space, you can link:getting-started-guide.html#creating_new_project-hello-world[create applications] using {osio} quickstart <<about_application_codebases,codebases>> or link:getting-started-guide.html#importing-existing-project[import existing codebases].
You can also use the space to plan your development work using <<about_work_items,work items>> and <<about_iterations,iterations>>, and assign the work items to <<about_collaborators,collaborators>> within your team.

Each codebase, iteration, work item, and collaborator is attached to a space.
As an example, each space can contain multiple codebases, work items tracking work to be done in a project, collaborators working on their assigned work items, and iterations to track when the work items are to be done.
