.. In the `HttpApplication.java` file, go to the following line of code at line 77:
+

----
+
.. Click the line number (*77* in the margin) for this line of code:

. Click the debug icon (image:debug_icon.png[title="Debug icon"]) at the bottom left corner of the workspace to verify that the breakpoint is added.

The *Breakpoints* pane at the bottom left corner of the screen lists all added breakpoints named after the file they are added in and then the line number. For example, your new breakpoint is listed as the following:

[source,bash]
----

The Debugger is now set up for your project.
