= Planning your development work

When you create a space, the *Create an Application* wizard is displayed. Close the wizard, so that you can plan an end to end development workflow before you launch the application.

{osio} planner provides a set of predefined templates based on common development methodologies such as Agile and Scenario Driven Development. The development process you select while creating the space determines the guided work item type hierarchy in the planner.

This example walks you through the Agile planning process to plan your work.

. In the dashboard of your space, select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page. The default *Backlog* view displays the *Work Items* for your space.
. Select the *Show Tree* check box to use the quick-add and in-line add options to quickly create workitems and their children.
. In the *Add Work Item* pane, select *Theme* from the drop-down list, type *Enable a complete developer work-flow in a continuous integration and delivery framework* as the title, and press kbd:[Enter] to create the theme.

. Create a child *Epic* for the *Theme* as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the (+) icon adjacent to the theme to see the in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane below it.

.. Select *Epic* from the drop-down list, type the title *User should be able to launch applications through a simple work-flow*, and Press kbd:[Enter].
