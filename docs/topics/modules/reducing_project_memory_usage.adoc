= Reducing project memory usage

Optimizing memory usage is important when using the Free Tier of OpenShift Online because this tier provides limited memory. Also, each additional project in {osio} requires an additional share of your OpenShift Online resources.

// for optimizing_memory_usage
ifeval::["{context}" == "optimizing_memory_usage"]
You can optimize your new quickstart to use less memory as follows:
endif::[]

// for spring-boot
ifeval::["{context}" == "spring-boot"]
Your OpenShift Online account must now share resources with two quickstart projects: the Hello World Vert.x project and the new Spring Boot HTTP project.

To optimize memory for the Spring Boot HTTP quickstart:
