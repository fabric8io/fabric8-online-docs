= Reducing project memory usage

Optimizing memory usage is important when using the Free Tier of OpenShift Online because this tier provides limited memory. Also, each additional project in {osio} requires an additional share of your OpenShift Online resources.

// for optimizing_memory_usage
ifeval::["{context}" == "optimizing_memory_usage"]
You can optimize your new quickstart to use less memory as follows:
endif::[]

// for spring-boot
ifeval::["{context}" == "spring-boot"]
Your OpenShift Online account must now share resources with two quickstart projects: the Hello World Vert.x project and the new Spring Boot HTTP project.

To optimize memory for the Spring Boot HTTP quickstart:
endif::[]

. Return to your Workspace browser tab. If your closed the tab, click *Create* and then the btn:[Open] to run your workspace.

. Copy the contents of the following file to your new YAML file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml].
+
IMPORTANT: Spaces are meaningful in YAML files. Ensure that the correct spacing is copied into your YAML file from the link.

. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
