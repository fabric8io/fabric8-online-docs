= Reducing project memory usage

Optimizing memory usage is important when using the Free Tier of OpenShift Online because this tier provides limited memory. Also, each additional project in {osio} requires an additional share of your OpenShift Online resources.

// for optimizing_memory_usage
ifeval::["{context}" == "optimizing_memory_usage"]
You can optimize your new quickstart to use less memory as follows:
endif::[]

// for spring-boot
ifeval::["{context}" == "spring-boot"]
Your OpenShift Online account must now share resources with two quickstart projects: the Hello World Vert.x project and the new Spring Boot HTTP project.

To optimize memory for the Spring Boot HTTP quickstart:
endif::[]

. Return to your {osio} workspace tab. If you need to reopen the workspace:
.. In your {osio} browser tab, click btn:[Create] > btn:[Codebases].

. Copy the contents of the following file to your new YAML file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml].

IMPORTANT: Spaces are meaningful in YAML files. Ensure that you copy the correct spacing into your YAML file from the link.
