= Analyzing your application stack dependencies

As you edit your application code, your Che workspace is automatically analyzing dependencies for the changes. 

. Return to your Che workspace browser tab.
. In the file explorer panel, double-click the `pom.xml` file.
. In the file editor, go to line 111 and add a line break.
. Add the following XML code to the file after the line break:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
  <artifactId>logback-core</artifactId>
  <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
----
+
. An error icon (red cross) appears next to the added lines of code. Move the mouse pointer over the icon to view the error message and a recommendation for improving the dependency.

The error indicates that the dependency analyzer has identified a high Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) score associated with the current version, 1.1.0. It also recommends using an alternate, secure version, 1.1.2, instead to fix the issue.

. In the code, update the version to `1.2.1`. The error icon disappears after this change.

. Commit these changes to add this dependency to your stack.

You have now learned how {OSIO} analytics automatically analyze dependencies in your code, identify security vulnerabilities, and recommend fixes.
