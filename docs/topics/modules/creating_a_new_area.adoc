= Creating a New Area

You can create a new child Area to group together related Work Items by type or functionality. When you create a new Collaboration Space, {osio} automatically creates a root Area with the same name. Each additional Area within the Collaboration Space is created as a child of the root Area or another existing Area in the Space.
