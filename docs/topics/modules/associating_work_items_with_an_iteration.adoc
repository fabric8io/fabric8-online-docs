= Associating Work Items with an Iteration

To associate a Work Item with an Iteration:

. Click the icon (image:kabob_white.png[title="Options"]) adjoining the Work Item and click btn:[Associate with Iteration] from the displayed options. The `Associate with Iteration` dialog box appears and displays which Iteration, if any, the Work Item is associated with.

. From the drop-down list, select the Iteration you want to associate your Work Item with and click btn:[Reassociate].

Selecting an Iteration from the left pane displays all Work Items associated with that Iteration.

You can remove an Iteration without selecting a replacement. This moves the Work Item to the Backlog. To move a Work Item to the Backlog, click the icon (image:kabob_white.png[title="Options"]) adjoining the Work Item and then click btn:[Move to Backlog] from the displayed options.

You can select btn:[Backlog] to display all the Work Items within a Space.
