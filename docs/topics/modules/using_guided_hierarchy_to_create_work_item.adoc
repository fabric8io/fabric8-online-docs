= Using the guided hierarchy to create a work item

NOTE: The space template you select determines the guided work item type hierarchy.

Create work items using the guided hierarchy as follows:

. Select the *Plan* tab at the top of the page to view the planner. The default *Backlog* view displays the top level work item type group for your space.
. Select the *Show Tree* check box to see the work items in a tree view. The tree view allows you to quickly add work items according to the guided hierarchy using the quick-add and in-line add options.
. Based on the vision statement for the product, use the quick-add option to create high level planning oriented work items, as follows:
.. In the *Add Work Item* pane, select the required high level work item type from the work item type drop-down list. The space template determines the available work item types. As per the scenario driven space template, you can create *Scenario*, *Fundamental*, or *Papercuts* type of work items, which are tracked under the *Scenarios* work item type group.

.. Specify an appropriate title for the work item in the *Work Item Title* field.
.. Press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item. Alternatively, to create the work item and see the detailed view for the work item, click btn:[Add and open]
. Create child work items for the high level work item types using the in-line add option as follows:
.. In the work item list, click the (+) icon adjacent to the high level work item for which you want to add child work items. The in-line *Add Child Work Item* pane is displayed below the work item.
.. From the work item type drop-down list, select the required child work item type. The space template determines the available child work item types. As per the scenario driven hierarchy, you can create *Experience*, or *Value Proposition* type of child work items. These work items are tracked under the *Experiences* work item type group.

.. Add a title to the work item and press kbd:[Enter] to create the work item.
. Similarly, use the in-line add option to create execution oriented child work item types for the second level of work items. The scenario driven hierarchy enables you to create *Feature* or *Bug* to track such work items.

. Use the in-line add option again to further break down the execution oriented work items. The scenario driven template gives you the option to create action oriented *Task* or *Bug* type of work items. The scenario driven template tracks all the execution oriented, *Feature*, *Task*, and *Bug* work items under the *Requirements* work item type group.
