= Cleaning Up Your OpenShift Online Account

{osio} generates artifacts within five projects (Kubernetes namespaces) in OpenShift Online. See <<viewing_projects_oso>> for details. After you create the Vert.X and Spring Boot HTTP quickstart projects, the limited resources available in the OpenShift Online Free Tier are nearly exhausted. You can now reset your {osio} and Openshift Online account resources to start afresh:

. In your `Profile` page, click btn:[Update Profile].
. Click btn:[Reset Environment]. A warning page appears with a summary of your {osio} account.

. In the dialog box, add your {osio} user name and click btn:[I understand my actions - erase my environment].
+

+
. After the environment is successfully erased, the success page displays:
+

+
. Click the check mark icon on the top right side of the page to see the `Jenkins` and `Che` status. Allow several minutes for this to load. When all the status indicators are green (see screen capture), you can use your {osio} account again. If the status indicators are not green after several minutes, see <<confirming_che_jenkins_status>> for troubleshooting information.

After completing these steps, your {osio} and OpenShift Online account resources are reset and ready for use with a new project.
