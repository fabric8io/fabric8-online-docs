= Approving the build pipeline

Several minutes after starting, your build pipeline is ready to be promoted to _Stage_.

The build pipeline includes steps for a _Stage_ build and a _Run_ build. _Stage_ is a production staging area to review and test your application before finalizing it and deploying the build on _Run_.

To stage your application and review it on _Stage_:

. If you are not on the *Pipelines* view, click *Create* from the options at the top of the screen and then click *Pipelines*.
. Click the icon (image:rollout_icon.png[title="Rollout"]) next to *Rollout to Stage* in the displayed pipeline. OpenShift Online provides this public URL to access the staged quickstart application.

+
. In a new browser tab, the HTTP Booster application runs on _Stage_. The Vert.x HTTP booster quickstart produces a simple API behind a REST endpoint over HTTP with a minimalist user interface.

+
NOTE: If the application does not load, see <<application_not_available>> for troubleshooting information.
+
. In the application, enter a name in the *Name* field and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application. The *Result* field displays the JSON result returning
from the API.

If the quickstart application on the _Stage_ build runs as expected, return to the {osio} browser tab and promote your application and build on _Run_   :

. Return to the {osio} tab which displays the *Pipeline* view.
. Click btn:[Input Required] at the *Approve* stage of the pipeline.

+
. Click btn:[Promote] to promote the build from the _Stage_ environment to the _Run_ environment. The rollout process from _Stage_ to _Run_ requires several minutes.
+

+
. Optionally, click *Build #1* to view the detailed progress in the OpenShift Online console view as your build is promoted to _Run_.
+

+
. When the *Pipeline* view indicates that the project is available in the _Run_ environment, click the icon (image:rollout_icon.png[title="Rollout"]) next to *Rollout to Run* to view the project in a new tab and test the application.
+

. You have now completed the task, *Test the application in Stage and approve to the Run environment*, in the *Test Iteration*. Ensure that you change the state of the work item to *Closed* using the *Plan* tab.
