= Changing the project code

The example project code includes a new route for *eventbus* and its supporting method. The project sets up *eventbus* to only allow outbound communications for the *my-feed* channel. Messages arriving in the *my-feed* channel are pushed to the browser using the SockJS bridge. This project includes a `vertx-eventbus.js` file along with the `index.html` file and also includes tweaks to the `index.html` file.

+
. In the `HttpApplication.java` file of your project, find the following line:
+
[source,java]
----
  protected static final String template = "Aloha, %s!";
----
+
. Add exclamation marks to the string. The line should now be:
+
[source,java]
----
  protected static final String template = "Aloha !!!, %s!";
----
+
. Save the changes (kbd:[Ctrl+s] or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS).
. Click the *run* option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). This runs the application and also provides the hot deploy feature. The following message appears when the run process completes:
+
----
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
----
+
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the *run* view to view your project.
