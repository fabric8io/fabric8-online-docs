= Using analytics at the deployment stage

When you create a new quickstart project, a new build is executed. {osio} analytics is triggered during the *Build Release* stage of the build pipeline. It analyzes your stack and its dependencies and provides a detailed report on the security issues and license issues affecting your dependencies along with insights on alternate and additional dependencies suitable for your stack. Use the stack report to make informed decisions about the open source dependencies in your stack.

.Prerequisites

Ensure that you deploy your project and <<creating_new_application-user-guide_pipelines,create a pipeline>> for your project.

.Procedure

. Navigate to menu:Create[Pipelines] to view the pipeline builds for your project.
. In the *Pipelines* view, under the *Build Release* stage, click btn:[Stack Report] to see the analysis report for your entire stack.
+

+
The report displays a summary of four key aspects relevant to your stack in the form of cards: *Security Issues*, *Licenses*, *Insights*, and *Dependency Details*.
+

+
. Click each of the cards to see a detailed analysis report for your stack and its dependencies:

Security Issues:: This card highlights the number of security issues in your stack, the highest Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score, and the number of dependencies with this high score.
+
Click the *Security Issues* card to see details on:

* Dependencies with security issues
* The number of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) found in each of your dependencies
* The highest Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score in your dependency and its CVE ID.
+
[NOTE]
====
A CVSS score highlighted in:

* Red indicates a severe vulnerability, with a score in the range of 7 - 10.
* Orange indicates a moderate vulnerability, with a score in the range of 4 - 6.9.
====

Licenses:: This card suggests an appropriate stack level license and flags conflicting, unknown, and restrictive licenses (licenses that are not commonly used in similar stacks or that do not work well with the stackâ€™s representative license) affecting your stack.
+
Click the *Licenses* card to see the following detailed information:

* The *Conflicting license(s) details* tab is displayed by default. It lists dependencies that conflict with licenses of other dependency or with the stack level license. It highlights the licenses which are affected in the dependency, and suggests alternate dependencies that go well with your stack, and avoid such conflicts.
* Click the *Unknown license(s) details* tab to see the list of dependencies with licenses unknown to {osio}. It highlights the affected or unknown license, and suggests alternate dependencies to replace such dependencies.

Insights:: Based on the analysis of other similar stacks, this card identifies usage outliers (dependencies not commonly used in similar stacks and that rarely go well together) in your stack and also highlights the number of companion (additional) dependencies that could augment your stack.
+
Click the *Insights* card to see the following insights:
+
image::detailed_insights.png[Detailed insights]
+
* The *Usage outliers details* tab is displayed by default. It identifies and lists dependencies in your stack that are not commonly used in similar stacks or that do not work well with other dependencies in the stack. It suggests alternate dependencies, suitable to your stack, to replace them. The *Confidence score* depicts the confidence of {osio} analytics on the suitability of the alternate dependency to your stack.
* Click the *Companion component details* tab to see a list of additional dependencies that you can add to your stack to enhance it. Based on the confidence score, you can decide on the suitability of the dependency to your stack and add it. You can also provide your feedback on the suggested dependencies.
Dependency Details:: This card lists the number of dependencies analyzed by {osio} and those unknown to it.
+
Click the *Dependency Details* card to see details on:

* The *Analyzed dependency details* tab is displayed by default. It lists details of all the dependencies analyzed by {osio} and the *Components check* section highlights security, usage, and license issues in them. It suggests alternate dependencies to replace dependencies with usage and license issues.
* The *Unknown dependency details* tab lists dependencies unknown to {osio} analytics.

. Expand the arrow adjacent to the dependency to see the following detailed information about the existing or the  suggested companion dependency:

* The current and latest available version of the dependency
* GitHub statistics relevant to it that help assess its popularity
* Licenses used by the dependency
* Tags associated with the dependency
+

+
In the case of usage outliers, details of the suggested replacement dependency are displayed along with those of the existing dependency.
These statistics help you compare the existing dependency with the alternate dependency and make a smart choice for your stack.

. To act on the analytics and insights provided by the report:
* In the *Security Issues* detailed view, click *Report an issue* to report the security vulnerability as an issue in the {osio} planner. This ensures all your team members are aware about the security issue and can take the necessary follow-up action.
* In the *Insights* detailed view, click *Create work item* to create auto-populated issues in {osio} planner for adding the suggested alternate or companion dependency.

You can now act upon the relevant input provided by the stack report and enhance your development project.
