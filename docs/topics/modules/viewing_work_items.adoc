= Viewing work items

The planner provides an interface to plan and execute your development work by creating work items, grouping them into work item type groups for efficient planning, and associating them with iterations for effective execution.

The _left pane_ of the planner displays:

* The work item type groups determined by the space template
* Your iterations outlining your development work
* Your saved filters

This pane can be hidden or displayed using the *Hide Panel* or *Show Panel* icon as required.

The _right pane_ displays the list of work items in your space that can be viewed either using the _tree view_ or the _flat view_.
