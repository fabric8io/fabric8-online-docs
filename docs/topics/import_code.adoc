= Importing an Existing Project from GitHub

:context: import-code

As an alternative to creating a new quickstart project, you can add an existing project in GitHub to {osio} as follows:

include::modules/e2e/fork_repo.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::modules/e2e/imp_project.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::modules/e2e/create_che_workspace.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::modules/e2e/prereq_che.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

[#changing_code]
== Changing the Quickstart's Code

You can change your project's code and preview the results as follows:

. In the `Project Explorer` view, double-click the following directories to expand them: `src` > `main` > `Java` > `io.openshift.booster`.
. In your project's `HttpApplication.java` file, find the following line:
+
```java
  protected static final String template = "Aloha !!, %s!";
```
+
. Add more exclamation marks. The line should now be:
+
```java
  protected static final String template = "Aloha !!!!!, %s!";
```
+
NOTE: The code includes a new route for *eventbus* and its supporting method. These set up *eventbus* to allow outbound-only communications for the *my-feed* channel.  Any messages arriving in the *my-feed* channel are pushed to the browser using this SockJS bridge. This project includes a `vertx-eventbus.js` file along with the `index.html` file and also includes tweaks to the `index.html`.

+
. Save the changes (kbd:[Ctrl+s] or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS).
. Click the `run` option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). The following message appears when the run process completes:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.
. Enter your name in the text box and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.
