= Optimizing your memory usage

:context: optimizing_memory_usage

After creating your first quickstart project, you need to optimize the application's memory usage. You can either:

* See a high level overview of the resources used in {osio}. See <<viewing_resource_usage>>.

* See the detailed memory and other usage information using OpenShift Online:
  1. Review your current memory usage. See <<reviewing_detailed_resource_information>>.
  2. Edit your project code to reduce your project's memory usages and commit the changes. See <<reducing_project_memory_usage-{context}>> and <<committing_pushing_changes_git-{context}>>
  3. Compare the memory usage after the changed code builds. See <<monitoring_your_oso_quota_usage>>.
