= Clearing Up Your OpenShift Online Account

{osio} generates artifacts within five projects (Kubernetes namespaces) in OpenShift Online. These artifacts use a significant amount of the limited resources available with OpenShift Online's Free Tier. Reset your {osio} and Openshift Online account resources as follows:

. *Delete your {osio} spaces*:
.. In the {osio} home page, click your name in the top right part of the page.
.. Click btn:[Profile] from the displayed options.
.. In the `Profile` page, click `Spaces`.
.. Click btn:[Delete] and then btn:[Remove] for each of the listed spaces.
+
NOTE: Deleting the spaces does not remove the GitHub repositories created for each of these spaces.
+
. *Reset your {osio} environment*:
.. In your `Profile` page, click btn:[Update Profile].
.. Click btn:[Reset Environment]. A warning page appears with a summary of your {osio} account.
.. Click btn:[Erase my {osio} Environment].
.. In the dialog box, add your {osio} user name and click btn:[I understand my actions - erase my environment].
.. After the environment is successfully erased, click the check mark icon in the top right side of the page to see the `Jenkins` and `Che` status.
