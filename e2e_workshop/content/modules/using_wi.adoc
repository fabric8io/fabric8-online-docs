= Using Work Items

Create a Work Item that tracks changing a string in a Quickstart project. Use the `Planner` view to create a new Work Item for your Space as follows:

. Click your name on the top right side of the screen.
. Click btn:[Profile] in the displayed options.
. Click btn:[Update Profile].
. In the `Experimental Features` part of the page, read the disclaimer and check the `I agree to the terms above and would like to opt into experimental features` option and then click btn:[Update] to use {osio}'s experimental features.
. Click your user name on the top left side of the page.
. Click the name of your new Space from the displayed options to return to that Space's dashboard view.
. Click btn:[Plan] to see the Planner view for your Space.  If experimental features have been enabled, the Planner view includes a green banner with the following message: `This feature is experimental. You can manage experimental features on your profile page. Got it!`
. Click `Create Work Item` at the bottom of the screen. This is the fastest option to create a new Work Item.
