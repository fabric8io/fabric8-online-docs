= Prerequisites for Using Your Che Workspace

Before using the Che workspace, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

. *Finish loading the workspace*: Before editing a project in a Che workspace, ensure that the workspace has finished loading. If the `Project Explorer` pane lists your project, the workspace has finished loading:

.. Click `Git` in the workspace menu to ensure that all the listed commands (except `Initialize Repository`) are available.

.. In the `Project Configuration` window, select `Maven` and click btn:[Save].
.. Click the `run` option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). For Vert.x projects, this sets server and the hot deploy option.
. A run terminal appears at the bottom pane of the Che workspace. When the *mvn build* finishes executing, the `run` view displays the following message:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
+
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.
. Enter your name in the text box and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.

You are now viewing and interacting with a private sandbox for your project run in OpenShift Online. This is different from `Stage` and `Run`. See <<pipelines.adoc#pipelines>> for details about `Stage` and `Run`. You can share this link with others to test your project in your sandbox environment.
