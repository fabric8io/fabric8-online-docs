che_debug. Click the `run` option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). This sets up the Vert.x server and provides the hot deploy option.
. A run terminal appears at the bottom pane of the Che workspace. Let the *mvn build* download the required dependencies and finish executing. When complete, the `run` view displays the following message:

```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```

. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.

At the end of these steps, you are viewing and interacting with a private sandbox of your project, which is being run by OpenShift Online. This is different from the Stage or Run URLs. You can share this link with others to use this application.
