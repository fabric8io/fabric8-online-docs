= Working With Pipelines

A new build/pipeline execution initiates immediately after a new Quickstart project is created. In a build pipeline, *Stage* and *Run* are individual OpenShift projects. `Stage` is a production staging area to review and test changes before they are finalized and staged on `Run`.

The new build pipeline pushes version 1.0.1 of your new project into *Stage* and then, after user approval, to *Run*.

Optionally, view the build pipeline's details in OpenShift Online:

. In the `Pipeline` page, click `Build #1` for the build pipeline in progress.
. When redirected, log into your OpenShift Online account.
. Click *View Log* to view the Jenkins instance's logs.
