= Changing the Quickstart's Code

You can change your project's code and preview the results as follows:

. In your Che workstation's `Project Explorer` view, navigate to the following file: `src` > `main` > `Java` > `io.openshift.booster` > `HttpApplication.java`.
. Find the following line in the file:
+
```java
protected static final String template = "Hello, %s!";
```
+
. Change *Hello* to *Bonjour* in the line:
+
```java
protected static final String template = "Bonjour, %s!";
```
+
. Save the changes using kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS).
. Click the `run` option (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). The following message displays when the run process is successfully completed:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.
. Add a string to the text box and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.
+

. In the GitHub repository page, click `Commits` to view all commits for your project and confirm that your recent changes are committed.
. Return to the {osio} pipeline view. Your project has a new pipeline build in progress, which includes your new commit. When required, click `Input required` and then click btn:[Promote] to promote your build.
