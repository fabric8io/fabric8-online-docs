= Stopping Existing Workspaces

Before creating a workspace for your project, ensure that the workspace for your previous project is stopped. Each running workspace uses your OpenShift Online resources. As a result, older workspaces must be stopped before creating new workspaces.

Review the workspace in your OpenShift Online account as follows:

. In your Space's dashboard, click btn:[Create].
. In the `Codebases` view, click btn:[Open] for the older project's workspace. Allow several minutes for the project to load.
. Stop the current workspace in one of two ways:
.. Click the `Workspace` and select `Stop` from the options.
.. Alternatively, within the target workspace:
... Click *>* next to the `Workspace` menu item on the left side of the workspace.

From the displayed list of all previously created workspaces, a green dot next to the name indicates if a workspace is not stopped.
... For a running space, click the stop icon under `ACTIONS`.

Your old workspace's resources are now reclaimed in your OpenShift Online account.
