= Creating a New Space and Quickstart Project

In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new Space. Users will be assigned to specific Spaces and all the work done will be in the context of the Space. Each Space must have a unique name.

. In the {osio} home page, click *Create a space* to create a new space.
. In the dialog box, add a unique name for your space.
. Use the drop-down menu for the `Templates` field to select a template for your new Space. For this example, select *Scenario Driven Planning* and click btn:[Create].
test_terminal double-click the name of the relevant Space from the list under `Recent spaces`.
. In the resulting `Analyze` screen for the Space, click btn:[Add to space] in the top right corner to view the `How would you like to get started?` menu.

The `How would you like to get started?` menu automatically displays after you create a new Space. To create a new Quickstart create_wiproject:

. Click btn:[Create a new Quickstart project].

. In the `Forge Wizard`:
.. Click the `Technology Stack` drop-down menu to select the appropriate project type. For this example, use the default value for this field: `Vert.x - Basic`.
.. In the `Name` field, add a unique name for your project.
.. In the `Top Level Package` field, change the value to *com.redhat*.
.. Leave the default value for the `Version` field and click btn:[Next].

. Select a build pipeline strategy. Pipelines allow developers to create a repeatable, reliable, and incrementally improving process to move the software from code to the proper execution environment. For this example, use the default value (`Release, Stage, Approve and Promote`) and click btn:[Next].

. In the `GitHub repository` step of the wizard:
.. The `Organization` field includes a drop-down list of your organizations. For this example, use the default value, which would be the organization name assigned to your personal GitHub account.
.. Use the default value for the `GitHub repository name` field and leave the `Description` field blank.
.. Click btn:[Next].

. The `Build configuration` screen displays the details for your `Jenkins Space` and options for web hooks and triggering builds. Use the default options for these fields and click btn:[Finish].

You have now created a Quickstart project for your Space. {osio} has added your project's pipeline into your OpenShift Online account and created a new GitHub repository for your project.

A confirmation screen appears, which includes a clickable `Git repositories` link that can be used to view your new project's GitHub repository.
