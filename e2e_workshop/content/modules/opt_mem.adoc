= Reduce the Hello World Project's Memory Usage

You can reconfigure your new quickstart to use less memory. This is particularly important using OpenShift Online's Free Tier because there are limits to the memory available with this level.

. In the Che workspace, navigate to the following folders for your project: `src` &#62; `main` &#62; `fabric8`.
. Right-click the `fabric8` folder icon and click `New` and `File` from the options.
. Name the new file *deployment.tml* and click btn:[OK]. The new file is created and displayed in the editor.
. Copy the contents of this yaml file to your new yaml file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml]. In yaml files, spaces are important. Copying the contents from a file preserves the required spaces.
. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
. Click `Git` in the menu on top of the page and then select `Commit`.
. In the dialog box:
.. Ensure that both files changed are selected to be included in the commit.
.. Add a commit message.
.. Ensure that the `Push committed changes to origin/master` option is selected.
.. Click btn:[Commit] to push the commit.

After adding a memory constraint for your project, you can monitor your OpenShift Online account's quota usage using the OpenShift CLI (oc) tool:

. Navigate to the following link in your browser to view your OpenShift Console: https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/console/
. Click the *?* icon next to your user name in the top right side of the console.
. From the menu options, click `Command Line Tools`.
. Use the download links from the `Command Line Tools` page for your operating system and install oc tools.
. In your computer's terminal (not the `Terminal` tab for your workspace), run the following command:
+
```cli
oc login https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/
```
+
. Use the following command during and after the new pod is used in OpenShift to monitor the quota usage:
+
```cli
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n <username>-stage
```
+
The output for the command displays as follows:
+
```cli
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: "1"
    limits.memory: 512Mi
```
+
. After you commit and push your new yaml file, a new pipeline build is triggered. When the pipeline build is rolled out to Stage, execute the following command again to see the change in memory usage:
+
```cli
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n <username>-stage
```
+
The output for the command displays as follows:
+
```cli
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: 488m
    limits.memory: 250Mi
```

Limiting the memory usage is particularly important when creating an additional quickstart project, which has its own pipeline and uses your OpenShift Online resources.
