[#opt_mem]
= Reduce the Hello World Project's Memory Usage

You can optimize your new quickstart to use less memory. This is particularly important when using OpenShift Online's Free Tier because it includes limited memory.

. In the Che workspace, expand the `src` &#62; `main` &#62; `fabric8` folders for your project.
. Right-click the `fabric8` folder icon and select `New` &#62; `File`.
. Name the new file *deployment.yml* and click btn:[OK]. The new file displays in the editor.
. Copy the contents of the following file to your new yaml file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml].
+
NOTE: Spaces are meaningful in yaml files. Ensure that the correct spacing is copied into your yaml file from the link.
+
. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
. Click `Git` in the menu on top of the page and then select `Commit`.
. In the dialog box:
.. Ensure that both the changed files are selected to be included in the commit.
.. Add a commit message.
.. Select the `Push committed changes to origin/master` option.
.. Click btn:[Commit]..

Monitor your OpenShift Online account's quota usage using the OpenShift CLI (oc) tool:

. Navigate to https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/console/ in your browser.
. In the OpenShift Console, click the *?* icon next to your user name.
. From the menu options, click `Command Line Tools`.
. Use the download links from the `Command Line Tools` page for your operating system and install oc tools.
. In your computer's terminal (not the `Terminal` tab for your workspace), run the following command:
+
```cli
oc login https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/
```
+
. Use the following command during and after the new pod is used in OpenShift to monitor and compare resource usage:
+
```cli
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n <username>-stage
```
+
An example of the output for this command is as follows:
+
```cli
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: "1"
    limits.memory: 512Mi
```
+
. Committing and pushing your new yaml file triggers a new pipeline build for your {osio} project. When the pipeline build is rolled out to Stage, execute the following command again to see the change in memory usage:
+
```cli
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n <username>-stage
```
+
An example of the output for this command after committing the yaml file is as follows:
+
```cli
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: 488m
    limits.memory: 250Mi
```

Optimizing memory usage is particularly important when creating more than one project in {osio}. Each additional project requires an additional share of your OpenShift Online resources. For OpenShift Online's Free Tier, see <<#cleanup_sb.adoc##cleanup_sb>> to reset your OpenShift Online and {osio} accounts after creating two projects.
