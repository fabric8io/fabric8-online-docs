= Reduce the Boot Spring Project's Memory Usage

Your {osio} space now has two quickstart projects running: the Hello World Vert.x project and the new Spring Boot project. Both projects use the same limited memory resources in OpenShift Online. As a result, you must reduce the memory usage for both projects.

See <<opt_mem.adoc#opt_mem>> to optimize memory usage for the Hello World project and use the following instructions for the Spring Boot project:

. In your Che workspace, expand the `src` > `main` > `fabric8` folders.
. Right-click the `fabric8` folder and select `New` > `File`.
. Name the new file *deployment.yaml*.
. Copy the following to your new yaml file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml].
+
NOTE: Spaces are meaningful in yaml files. Ensure that the correct spacing is copied into your yaml file from the link.
+
. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
