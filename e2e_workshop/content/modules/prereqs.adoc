*Browser Requirements:*

. We currently only recommend using {osio} with Google Chrome. Additional browsers will be added here as they are tested.
. Ensure that you run {osio} in Chrome's *Incognito Mode*. This is recommended because you may need to clear your browser's history to troubleshoot or use {osio}.

*General Requirements:*

. Ensure that you have a GitHub account.
. Sign up for an OpenShift Online account at https://www.openshift.com/.
. Register to join the {osio} developer preview at https://openshift.io/.
