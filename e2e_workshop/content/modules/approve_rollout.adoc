. In the dialog box, click btn:[Promote] to promote the build from the public URL for *Stage* to the public URL for the *Run* namespace. The rollout process from *Stage* to *Run* requires several minutes. You can view the detailed progress in the OpenShift Online console view.
. When the `Pipeline` view shows that the project is successfully promoted to the *Run* namespace, click the icon next to `Rollout to Run` to view the project in a new tab.
