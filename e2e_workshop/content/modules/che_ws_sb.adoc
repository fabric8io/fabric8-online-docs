= Creating a Workspace for the Spring Boot Project

Ensure that any running workspaces are stopped, then create a new workspace:

. Return to the space dashboard in {osio}.
. Click `Create` to view the `Codebases` page.
. Click `Create workspace` for your Spring Boot project. Ensure that pop ups are allowed and the new workspace launches automatically in a new tab.
+
[WARNING]
====
If a new tab does not appear, do not click `Create Workspace` again because this creates an additional (unnecessary) workspace and wastes your OpenShift Online resources. The new tab does not display if your browser has blocked the pop up that creates this new workspace. To resolve this:

. Click the blocked pop up icon in your browser's URL field.
. Select the `Always allow` option for pop ups from {osio} (see screen capture).
. Click the new workspace URL in the same dialog box to display the new Che workspace in a new tab.

. When the workspace is ready, click btn:[Open] to view the new workspace.
. In your new workspace, click the `Terminal` tab and run the following command:
+
```cli
cd myspringboot
mvn test
```
+
When the maven test succeeds, the `BUILD SUCCESS` message appears in the terminal view. You can only commit and push changes to your GitHub repository after the maven test succeeds.
. In the `Project Explorer` view, double-click the `src` > `main` > `java` > `io.openshift.booster` > `service` folders.
. Double-click the `GreetingController.java` file to view it in the editor.
. Add a line break at line 38, then type *@* and then use kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to view a list of context-sensitive options.
. From the list, select `RequestMapping`.
. Edit the code to include the following code:
+
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/goodbye")
public String goodbye(@RequestParam(value="name", defaultValue="World") String name) {
      return "Goodbye " + name + " " +  new java.util.Date();
}
```
+
The added code appears as follows:

+
. Save your changes using kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS).
.
. Click the `run` option (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). This sets up the Spring Boot server. Unlike the Vert.x Quickstart project, the hot deploy option is not available for Spring Boot projects.
. In the `run` terminal, the *mvn build* command runs and downloads the required dependencies. When complete, the `run` view displays the following message:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
+
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.
. Append the following string to the preview URL in your browser:
+
```url
/api/goodbye?name=Samwell%20Gamgee
```
+
. If successful, the amended preview URL displays the following:
