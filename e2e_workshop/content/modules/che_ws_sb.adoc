= Creating a Workspace for the Spring Boot Project

Before creating a workspace for your new Spring Boot project, ensure that the workspace for your previous project (from the Hello World) has automatically stopped. You can review the workspace in your OpenShift Online account as follows:

. In your space's dashboard, click btn:[Create]. The default codebases view appears.
. Click btn:[Open] for the Hello World project's workspace. Allow several minutes for it to load the project.
. You can stop the current workspace in one of two ways:
.. Click the `Workspace` menu item and select `Stop` from the options to stop the current workspace.
.. Alternatively, wiew workspace history and stop the workspace:
... Click the *>* button next to the `Workspace` menu item on the left side of the workspace.

+
From the displayed list of all previously created workspaces, a green dot next to the name indicates if a workspace is not stopped.
... For a running space, click the stop icon under `ACTIONS`. When your workspace is stopped, your OpenShift Online resources are reclaimed.

After stopping any running workspaces, create a new workspace:

. Return to the space dashboard in {osio}.
. Click `Create` to view the `Codebases` page.
. Click `Create workspace` for your Spring Boot project. Ensure that pop ups are allowed and the new workspace launches automatically in a new tab.
+
[WARNING]
====
If a new tab does not appear, do not click `Create Workspace` again because this creates an additional (unnecessary) workspace and wastes your OpenShift Online resources. The new tab does not display if your browser has blocked the pop up that creates this new workspace. To resolve this:

. Click the blocked pop up icon in your browser's URL field.
. Select the `Always allow` option for pop ups from {osio} (see screen capture).
. Click the new workspace URL in the same dialog box to display the new Che workspace in a new tab.

. When the workspace is ready, click btn:[Open] to view the new workspace.
. In your new workspace, click the `Terminal` tab and run the following command:
+
```cli
cd myspringboot
mvn test
```
+
Wait for the `BUILD SUCCESS` message to appear in the terminal to confirm that the maven test succeeded before committing or pushing changes in your code to your GitHub repository.
. In the `Project Explorer` view, double-click the `src` > `main` > `java` > `io.openshift.booster` > `service` folders.
. Double-click the `GreetingController.java` file to view it in the editor.
. Add a line break at line 38, then type *@* and then use kbd:[Ctrl+Space] to see a list of proposed additions.
. From the list, select `RequestMapping` and then edit the code to look like the following:
+
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/goodbye")
public String goodbye(@RequestParam(value="name", defaultValue="World") String name) {
      return "Goodbye " + name + " " +  new java.util.Date();
}
```
+
The resulting file appears as follows:
+

+
. Save your changes using the kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) shortcut.
. Click the `run` option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). This sets up the Spring Boot server. Note that unlike Vert.x, the hot deploy option is not available for Spring Boot projects.
. A run terminal appears at the bottom pane of the Che workspace. Let the *mvn build* download the required dependencies and finish executing. When complete, the `run` view displays the following message:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
+
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.
. Add the following text to the end of the preview URL in your browser:
+
```url
/api/goodbye?name=Samwell%20Gamgee
```
+
. If successful, the amended preview URL displays the following:
