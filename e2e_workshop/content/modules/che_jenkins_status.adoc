.. In the drop down options, click *Profile*.

.. In the profile edit page, scroll to the bottom of the page and click *Update tenant*. This initiates an update in your OpenShift Online account.
.. Allow approximately five minutes for the version numbers in the status display to refresh. Yellow triangle icons (see screen capture) appear while tenant updates Che and Jenkins. When the update is complete, the green check marks and version numbers display.
