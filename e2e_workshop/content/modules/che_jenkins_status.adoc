. Confirm the version numbers displayed for your Che and Jenkins are the most recent versions:
.. Confirm the latest Che version using https://github.com/fabric8-services/fabric8-tenant/blob/master/TEAM_VERSION[the {osio} GitHub repository].
.. Confirm the latest version of Jenkins by asking in the support channel (`#openshiftio` on MatterMost). See <<support.adoc#support>> for details.

. To update your Che and Jenkins versions:
.. In your {osio} home page, click your name on the top right corner of the screen.
.. In the drop down options, click *Profile*.
.. In the profile page, click *Update Profile*.
.. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click *Update tenant*. This initiates an update in your OpenShift Online account.
.. Allow approximately five minutes for the version numbers in the status display to refresh. Yellow triangle icons (see screen capture) appear while tenant updates Che and Jenkins. When the update is complete, the green check marks appear with the updated version numbers for Che and Jenkins.
