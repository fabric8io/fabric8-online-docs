= Run the Debug Command

After setting up the Debugger, use the Debug command for your project:

. Click `Run` from the menu options.
. Select the `Debug` option and then the `Remote Java` option.
. A message appears when the Remote debugger successfully connects.

NOTE: If your Remote Debugger connection fails, restart your Chrome browser and use a new Incognito tab to try again.
+
. Click `Terminal` to view the terminal tab.
. Run the following command to start debugging:
```
curl localhost:8080/api/goodbye
```

You can now review variables in the `Debug` tab. You can also use the `Resume`, `Step Into`, `Step Over`, and `Step Out` option during the debugging process.
