[[create_space]]
=== Create a New Space

In {osio}, the first step for any new project is to create a new Space. Users will be assigned to specific Spaces and all the work done will be in the context of the Space. Each Space must have a unique name.

. In the {osio} home page, click *Create a space* to create a new space.
. In the dialog box, add a unique name for your space.
. Use the drop-down menu for the `Templates` field to select a template for your new Space. For this example, select *Scenario Driven Planning* and click btn:[Create].
test_terminal double-click the name of the relevant Space from the list under `Recent spaces`.
. In the resulting `Analyze` screen for the Space, click btn:[Add to space] in the top right corner to view the `How would you like to get started?` menu.

image::get_started_menu.png[How would you like to get started menu]

The `How would you like to get started?` menu automatically displays after you create a new Space. To create a new Quickstart create_wiproject:

. Click btn:[Create a new Quickstart project].

. In the `Forge Wizard`:
.. Click the `Technology Stack` drop-down menu to select the appropriate project type. For this example, use the default value for this field: `Vert.x - Basic`.
.. In the `Name` field, add a unique name for your project.
.. In the `Top Level Package` field, change the value to *com.redhat*.
.. Leave the default value for the `Version` field and click btn:[Next].

. Select a build pipeline strategy. Pipelines allow developers to create a repeatable, reliable, and incrementally improving process to move the software from code to the proper execution environment. For this example, use the default value (`Release, Stage, Approve and Promote`) and click btn:[Next].

. In the `GitHub repository` step of the wizard:
.. The `Organization` field includes a drop-down list of your organizations. For this example, use the default value, which would be the organization name assigned to your personal GitHub account.
.. Use the default value for the `GitHub repository name` field and leave the `Description` field blank.
.. Click btn:[Next].

. The `Build configuration` screen displays the details for your `Jenkins Space` and options for web hooks and triggering builds. Use the default options for these fields and click btn:[Finish].
test_terminal
You have now created a Quickstart project for your Space. {osio} has added your project's pipeline into your OpenShift Online account and created a new GitHub repository for your project.

A confirmation screen appears, which includes a clickable `Git repositories` link that can be used to view your new project's GitHub repository.

[[pipelines]]
=== Working With Pipelines

A new build/pipeline execution initiates immediately after a new Quickstart project is created. It pushes version 1.0.1 of your new project into *Stage*, awaiting approval, and then *Run*. Out of this build pipeline, *Stage* and *Run* are OpenShift projects.

image::pipeline_running.png[A Running Pipeline Build]

Optionally, click `Build #1` to view the build pipeline in OpenShift Online. After logging in to your OpenShift Online account, click *View Log* to view the Jenkins instance's logs.

image::oso_pipeline.png[A Running Pipeline Build in OpenShift Online]

[[view_proj_gh]]
=== Viewing Your Project in GitHub

After reviewing your pipeline build running in OpenShift Online and {osio}, view your project's code in GitHub as follows:

. Return to your Space's dashboard. From the {osio} home page, click the name of the Space to view its dashboard.
. In the `Codebases` part of the dashboard, click the name of your project's codebase. This takes you to your project's code in GitHub.

. Copy the contents of this yaml file to your new yaml file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml]. In yaml files, spaces are important. Copying the contents from a file preserves the required spaces.
. Use kbd:[Ctrl+s] (or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS) to save your changes.
. Click `Git` in the menu on top of the page and then select `Commit`.
. In the dialog box:
.. Ensure that both files changed are selected to be included in the commit.
.. Add a commit message.
.. Ensure that the `Push committed changes to origin/master` option is selected.
.. Click btn:[Commit] to push the commit.
+
image::mem_commit.png[Commit Changes]

After adding a memory constraint for your project, you can monitor your OpenShift Online account's quota usage using the OpenShift CLI (oc) tool:

. Navigate to the following link in your browser to view your OpenShift Console: https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/console/
. Click the *?* icon next to your username in the top right side of the console.
. From the menu options, click `Command Line Tools`.
. Use the download links from the `Command Line Tools` page for your operating system and install oc tools.
. In your computer's terminal (not the `Terminal` tab for your workspace), run the following command:
+
```cli
oc login https://console.starter-us-east-2.openshift.com/
```
+
. Use the following command during and after the new pod is used in OpenShift to monitor the quota usage:
+
```cli
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n <username>-stage
```
+
The output for the command displays as follows:
+
```cli
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: "1"
    limits.memory: 512Mi
```
+
. After you commit and push your new yaml file, a new pipeline build is triggered. When the pipeline build is rolled out to Stage, execute the following command again to see the change in memory usage:
+
```cli
oc get quota compute-resources -o yaml -n <username>-stage
```
+
The output for the command displays as follows:
+
```cli
status:
  hard:
    limits.cpu: "2"
    limits.memory: 1Gi
  used:
    limits.cpu: 488m
    limits.memory: 250Mi
```

Limiting the memory usage is particularly important when creating an additional quickstart project, which has its own pipeline and uses your OpenShift Online resources.

image::che_dash.png[Che Dashboard Link From Within a Workspace]
+
From the displayed list of all previously created workspaces, a green dot next to the name indicates if a workspace is not stopped.
... For a running space, click the stop icon under `ACTIONS`. When your workspace is stopped, your OpenShift Online resources are reclaimed.

After stopping any running workspaces, create a new workspace:

. Return to the space dashboard in {osio}.
. Click `Create` to view the `Codebases` page.
. Click `Create workspace` for your Spring Boot project. Ensure that pop ups are allowed and the new workspace launches automatically in a new tab.
+
[WARNING]
====
If a new tab does not appear, do not click `Create Workspace` again because this creates an additional (unnecessary) workspace and wastes your OpenShift Online resources. The new tab does not display if your browser has blocked the pop up that creates this new workspace. To resolve this:

. Click the blocked pop up icon in your browser's URL field.
. Select the `Always allow` option for pop ups from {osio} (see screen capture).
. Click the new workspace URL in the same dialog box to display the new Che workspace in a new tab.

+
```java
@RequestMapping("/api/goodbye")
public String goodbye(@RequestParam(value="name", defaultValue="World") String name) {
      return "Goodbye " + name + " " +  new java.util.Date();
}
```
+
The resulting file appears as follows:

. If successful, the amended preview URL displays the following:
+
image::samwise_result.png[Preview URL Result]

[[reduce_mem]]
==== Reduce the Boot Spring Project's Memory Usage

Your {osio} space now has two quickstart projects running: the Hello World Vert.x project, and the new Spring Boot project. Both projects use the same limited memory resources in OpenShift Online, therefore you must reduce the memory usage for both projects.

See <<opt_mem>> for the Hello World project and use the following instructions for the Spring Boot project:

. In your Che workspace's `Project Explorer` view, double-click the `src` > `main` > `fabric8` folders.
. Right-click the `fabric8` folder and click `New` and `File` to create a new file.
. Name the new file *deployment.yaml*.
. Copy the contents of this yaml file to your new yaml file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/burrsutter/vertx-eventbus/master/src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml[deployment.yaml]. In yaml files, spaces are important. Copying the contents from a file preserves the required spaces.
