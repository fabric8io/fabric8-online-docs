= Importing an Existing Project from GitHub

As an alternative to creating a new quickstart project, you can add an existing project in GitHub to {osio} as follows:

include::modules/fork_repo.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::modules/imp_project.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::modules/create_che_workspace.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

include::modules/prereq_che.adoc[leveloffset=+1]

. <<change_code>>

[[change_code]]
=== Changing the Quickstart's Code

You can change your project's code and preview the results as follows:

. In the `Project Explorer` view, double-click the following directories to expand them: `src` > `main` > `Java` > `io.openshift.booster`.
. In your project's `HttpApplication.java` file, find the following line:
+
```java
  protected static final String template = "Aloha !!, %s!";
```
+
. Add more exclamation marks. The line should now be:
+
```java
  protected static final String template = "Aloha !!!!!, %s!";
```
+
NOTE: The code includes a new route for *eventbus* and its supporting method. These set up *eventbus* to allow outbound-only communications for the *my-feed* channel.  Any messages arriving in the *my-feed* channel are pushed to the browser using this SockJS bridge. This project includes a `vertx-eventbus.js` file along with the `index.html` file and also includes tweaks to the `index.html`.

+
. Save the changes (kbd:[Ctrl+s] or kbd:[Cmd+s] for macOS).
. Click the `run` option from the Run button (image:tri_run.png[title="Run button"]). The following message appears when the run process completes:
+
```
[INFO] INFO: Succeeded in deploying verticle
```
. Click the blue preview URL at the top of the `run` view to view your project.
. Enter your name in the text box and click btn:[Invoke] to test the application.

====
NOTE: If needed, find the link for your project's GitHub repository as follows:

. Return to the {osio} tab in your browser.

. Click `Create` and then the `Codebases` option.

. From the list of codebases for your space, click the name of your current project. The GitHub repository for the project appears in a new tab.
====

. In the GitHub repository page, click `Commits` to view all commits for your project and confirm that your recent changes are committed.
. Return to the {osio} pipeline view. Your project has a new pipeline build in progress, which includes your new commit. When required, click `Input required` and then click btn:[Promote] to promote your build. You can also monitor the build's progress in your OpenShift Online account:
